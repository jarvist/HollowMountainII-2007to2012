# 2008 --- Votla Gora

## Introduction

The main focus of the Votla Gora 2008 Expedition to the Tolminski Migovec plateau, Western Slovenia, was the connection of Sistem Migovec (11493m - 5th longest in Slovenia) with Vrtnarija (5229m - 11th longest) to make the second longest cave in Slovenia (16722+m). Separation was 28m on the centre line with many going leads. This was not achieved, but 1.2km of cave passage was found and explored.

The part of Sistem Migovec that we were attempting to connect to was the bottom of M2, the original deep cave on Migovec pushed back in the early 1970s by the Slovenian JSPDT. Below the epic Tolminski Silos pitch (120m), the cave shut down into a series of small pitches with extremely tight rift, which had to be exploded open for passage. Exploration finished in the 1970s at yet another such rift.

2008 was also the first ICCC Slovenia expedition with a name - 'Votla Gora', meaning 'Hollow Mountain'. This was an idea, shamelessly copied from the recent OUCC Ario Caves expeditions, which instantly became a useful tradition. 

## Exploration Diary

During the first two weeks of expedition, the UK team rebolted and rerigged M2 via the original, more direct, entrance to the original pushing point. Once there the UK team attacked the rift with hammers and chisels, but the progress was slow. In the middle of the expedition an experienced Slovenian caver with access to explosives came on a trip at the same time as another team explored some of the near passage in Vrtnarija. This trip obliterated a large rock that was blocking the rift, but also collapsed the wall of the rift. Net distance gained - minus 50 cm! However, with another session of manual work the choss was cleared. Perhaps worryingly, the extremely loud explosion was not heard by the other party in Vrtnarija, though one must add that they were extensively 'gardening' large rocks down the 52m Dangermouse pitch!

Early exploration in Vrtnarija was concerned with extending the 'bottom' end of Captain Kangaroo. The first recce trip was over 12hrs in spite of no new rigging taking place, and concluded that significant work was required just to improve the rigging and expand some of the more arduous squeezes. In particular there were three tight sections of rift in the 'Mudslump' extensions from 2007. As such, the first few trips down to this area of the cave consisted of two parties - an advanced one pushing the bottom end while the other progressed slowly 'improving' (in many cases instigating...) the SRT rigging. For one notable pitch, "Kill 'em All" which had been rigged for no apparent reason without a traverse line, the advanced party beckoned the clean-up group down to rig the pitch safely before they would ascend!

This after a section of acrobatic rift below Kill'Em All (p22), Dark Tranquility (p44) was discovered. The leads were very much ongoing - another pitch, and many windows. There were also entering avens. However, on inputing the survey data (we have a solar-powered laptop running Survex in our mountain top bivy), we discovered that we had dropped well below the bottom of M2 and therefore our current connection possibilities.

As such, attention shifted to higher leads to try and secure a connection in 2008. From the "Something Fishy" chamber a series of pitches were explored which included the impressive Dangermouse (p52). The leads at the bottom are rather dubious, but it makes an extremely pleasant 72m shaft series (Penfold, Dangermouse, Green Back, Giblet Breakfast) which has a very valuable commodity on it indeed - a seemingly faithful stream enters halfway down Dangermouse and collects in a secluded 2m diameter plunge pool.

The Captain Kangaroo series is extraordinarily dry after Bonus Chamber (it is actual dust, not water vapour, that ruins flash photos in this part of the cave), and the water on Dangermouse is likely to be an important part of future underground camping plans for 2009.

From Kill'em All, a number of avens are noted. One of these was gained by a rather gung ho climb with uncertain belay to reach rift that led away from the pitch. On a future trip, the rigging was improved to an acceptable level and the rift was pushed to a squeeze. This soon gave in to hammer attack, and led on to a initially upsetting pitch head. There was clearly something big and echoing below, but the pitch head was initially a fair squeeze for an anorexic cat! Disturbingly, considering it was also our floor, the rock around the pitch head shattered easily and with a few hours of work produced something probably passable. The rotten nature of the rock was a concern when placing the belays, and gained this section of cave the name 'Cheesecake'. A short 10 meter pitch dropped onto an epic rock bridge in a large chamber, with shafts disappearing down (perhaps combining below) on either side with multiple second free falls. A notable rift led off South (towards M2) from the far side of the chamber, but required a bolt traverse out to it. By survey, this rock bridge is 21 meters directly above Dark Tranquility (p44), so it is likely that at least one of the pitches connects.

Due to a shortage of gear, a trip was made down the 'Olympic Rift' arm of Captain Kangaroo to recover equipment and scavenge rope from the (left rigged since 2007) pitches. The exploration end was a tight rift leading to a very large space, most likely a reconnection to the Space Odyssey / Concorde pitch in the main Vrtnarija shaft series. An unsuccessful attempt was made on the squeeze - it required expanding. The pitches were derigged and the rope removed to the bone dry Traverse Chamber for immediate use in 2009.

In this region a surface dig started and quickly broke into considerable passage with a large draft. This was pushed very actively for a number of trips, before an unfortunate connection being found into Jelly Chamber of Vrtnarija. As the explorers at the time commented "Well, at least its 800m deep now!". This Vilinska Jama entrance demonstrates the worth of spending time and effort on surface excavations, as well as pointing to the plausibility of checking all the small side passages in established systems.

Above the Vrtnarija/Vilinska valley is a limestone pavement that extends from beyond the entrance to M2. Here a surface cave, E1, was discovered in 2007 with a ~20m entrance pitch. During 2008 some stones were excavated to an extremely tight (sub human) sized pitch head blowing strongly. This will require chemical persuasion to pass, but due to the (now surface surveyed) location, is a cave of some interest for 2009. Strangely for a surface cave it has some well defined cave formation (large meander), which appears to have been saved from infill by an overhanging entrance and position next to the edge of the plateau.

On the mountain we were joined for a couple of weeks by the younger generation of the Slovenian JSPDT. The majority of their efforts were directed to a cave on the Western edge of the plateau, gained by a rather jaw-dropping abseil of 100m into the mile-deep Tolminka valley! This cave "Monatip", whose entranced was noted in 2006 and exploration begun in summer 2007, is very different in nature to the other mountain caves, being mostly horizontal with the entrance at 1730m appearing to be a dried stream way. Monatip was extended to a total surveyed length of 710m, before connecting into the Primadona / U-Bend system at -151m. The exit via the easy Primadona shaft system was welcome!

It is unclear whether Monatip will be revisited in the future. Some of the original enthusiasm for its exploration was it heading South-East into 'blank mountain', but unfortunately it quickly developed back towards the South-West and Primadona. However, it certainly indicates that Primadona itself is a very fertile area for further exploration.

Also on the Western Plateau is Planika Jama, discovered simultaneously with Monatip. Far more vertical in nature and partially choked with snow, this was pushed to an ice filled chamber with 'phreatic like' blow holes through the ice. Unfortunately this original chamber was not reached due to the shifting ice levels - lots of snow fell in the Winter before the expedition, but also a lot of rain in the spring. In Planika this appeared to have drilled a 1m diameter hole through the initial snow plug which gained an icy vadose development which dropped via a short pitch to a tight blowing rift. Armed with only hammer and chisels, three cavers spent a full day smashing this rift to reach a tight squeeze into a further chamber. Exploration was left at this extremity. On another occasion, a window noticed near a rebelay ledge was pushed (again necessitating the expansion of tight rift) to gain a large chamber which actually went higher than the original entrance to the cave.

In Sistem Mig, a return was made to the pitch explored in 2007 named Plopzilla (P105). The objectives were to photograph the large pitch, investigate the extension boulder choke on one side of the pitch, and to derig the rope to NCB for use in future years looking at other possible shafts coming off this neglected area of the system. The boulder choke was climbed down through for tens of meters, halting when reaching a committing climb down through the ever unstable boulders. Once everyone present had confirmed that "it goes, but I'm not going there" they derigged. Unfortunately the long exposure film photographs taken with the aid of manually fired flashes on abseiling into the shaft were badly fogged, probably due to the camera not being so light tight after its many caving trips! A great pity, as the shaft had a beautiful fluted triangular-prism cross section.

NCB still holds interest for us, for though it was discovered in 1995 and provided the key for the discoveries of 1996 it has since been visited rarely (due to its long distance in time from the surface). A fair amount of surface prospecting has been concerned with investigating the clear valley located on the mountain top above which contains the small M15 and M17 caves. M17 was re-entered but found to be choked with ice. Small caves were found nearby initial digging has been started.

The weekend after the expedition van headed home, a small Slovene / English team went back down M2 armed with an enormous drill & battery. With 6 shot holes they blew their way through the rift, to the head of a short pitch.

This was returned to in October 2008, and dropped - all the new finds in M2 being surveyed at the same time. The new pushing front is another, almost impenetrable rift, and a climb up into a series of tight phreatic passage. The survey data indicates that M2 itself is trending away from Captain Kangaroo. During the expedition a major error was discovered in our survey data - namely that the wrong M2 entrance (there are two, separated by 25m horizontal) was connected into the surface survey. This caused a jump in the position of the bottom of M2, taking it further from Vrtnarija.

With the corrected data, our closest approach is now 23m between the large chamber found below Cheesecake and the confluence at the end of M2.

## Exploration Summary

In summary, Migovec now has three major systems and over a dozen smaller caves in active exploration. The exploration in Vrtnarija was at the very end of our endurance limits - the minimal trip length to achieve anything was 15hrs. Our plans are to camp down there in 2009 in order to have far more man hours at the 'coal face' and to offer the psychological and physiological refuge of a camp in a location that, in spite of its relatively shallow depth, is truly a long way from a safe place.

The mountain is unique in having such complicated Alpine cave formation at various depths, and now constitutes 21.988km of passage beneath just a square kilometre of surface.

Everything newly explored was surveyed to BCRA Grade 4b, underground photography as part of documentation took place in Vrtnarija, E1, Plopzilla (Sistem Mig) and Planika. We were limited by there being only one underground photographer on the expedition.

A new survey on an East-West projection has been drawn of M2 and Vrtnarija.

## Across the mountains --- an unexperienced way to reach Mig

After two years with the ICCC, I finally made the decision to become a Migovecer. Having done some cave exploration in Hungary, my idea of such activities was spending endless hours of underground digging, in passages of at most a 40 cm high, half-filled with dirty cold water...

Numbers better characterise these circumstances than words: in 10 years' time, my Hungarian club made a steady progress of 400 m, the discovery of almost every new meter being heavily aided by the products of the HILTI company. Thus, I was eagerly awaiting the Mecca of alpine-style caving and cave exploration. First, I spent a couple of days at a Croatian-Hungarian caving expo, which had the double advantage of being located next to the wonderful Zrmanja river, and  to the local pub.

But after this wellness-spa holiday, I felt the urge to start true caving, in the middle of the wilderness, on top of the unknown, mighty Migovec. So by hitch-hiking and a train journey, I arrived at Lake Bohinj to meet a friend and toss a day at the lake, after which I had the illuminating idea of walking across the mountains instead of taking public transportation to Tolmin and the going up from there.

According to my plans and my speed estimates, the trip could be made in a day's time if one started early, thus even saving time compared to the train journey! Thus, early in the morning, I started my ascent up to Dom na Komni. This path does endless hairpins up to the plateau, and no wonder, I soon realised that the progress was much slower than anticipated. Inexperienced in the Migovec conditions, I packed up well: a complete cooking kit, various layers of clothing, and even some rope completed the filling of my backpack and a large tackle-sack, which altogether weighed about 30 kg's, not counting my secret meat stash weighing a couple of kilos (which became sort of a tradition since then), so I truly felt like a soldier of the first world war.

By the time I reached the hut, it was clear that the night will be spent by bivouacking (as the money possibly spent for the hut fees was rather spent on beer). So I made (or rather struggled) my way to the former military camp, and set up my sleeping bag in the bushes, my torn poncho being the only protection against rain -  but why would it rain anyway in such a wonderful, starry night, without a single cloud being visible, and a wonderful weather forecast for the coming week?

Having fallen asleep with such positive thoughts, my dream was interrupted by a quite uncomfortable noise: thunder! The situation was not welcoming, and at this moment I was not quite sure anymore whether it was a good idea to liquidate my accommodation fees...

However, a speedy action was needed, and luckily, I discovered a small black hole next to the bushes. A cave! I imagined my first cave exploration on Mig a bit differently, but here it was - speedily, I managed to remove a couple of rocks blocking the entrance, and enlarged the hole so that it could fit at least my packs plus half of me, the other half covered by the torn poncho.

Of course, I hoped for a bit bigger, maybe down to -1000, but for the moment being, this was sufficient enough to survive the storm - which job it did at an agreeable level. It was neither dry nor comfortable, but at least it gave the feeling of some protection against the thunders, which hit the bushes around me in an alarming frequency. Finally, the rain stopped, and it was time to recover my possessions, and to start the remaining part of the journey.

This was a bit complicated by the mist that now covered everything - with about 10 m  visibility, in the middle of the Northern plateau, with way too much load, and finally, on the wrong side of Kuk, it was definitely not prospecting the most jolly day hike. Somehow I managed to reach the saddle between Kuk and Skrbina, and from here, descended down to the Migovec plateau following my compass bearings.

The task now was to find the bivvy, the only information of which was a vaguely positioned red dot on my map (I didn't know about the magic string then...) So I wandered a bit up and down, and finally at the edge of total exhaustion, surrounded by fog, a figure appeared on a rock slab above me - a person with long hair, a long beard, barefoot and wearing a long tunic - it could be nobody else, than Jesus!

At that moment, I realised that I never really imagined Heaven, but if I did so by any means, the resulting scenery would definitely differ this place. I also thought that it would be quite a hard task to collect all my sins, adding to the final effort of crawling up the slope ahead of me, by the time I meet Jesus... Anyway, I made it to him, and I gladly realised that the ghostly figure was a most real person: James Huggett! Thus, my adventurous trip across the mountains has ended, and soon I was welcomed by the other cavers, and had my fist glimpse of the ever-welcoming Bivvy.

## The Slov magic (2008)

Shortly after arriving to the plateau, I found myself getting ready for a trip. Not only a trip, in the ordinary sense, but a real Exploration Trip, with a goal none less than trying to remove the large boulder blocking the tight rift at the bottom of M2. I was chosen to be the lucky one who accompanies the Living Legend of Tolmin cavers. Soon I found myself holding a nice yellow tacklesack, with the instruction of “be gentle with it”. And this was not without reason. In the bag there was to be found an original memento of the great war, a product of the ever famous factory in Glasgow, dated to 1937.  A well educated friend of mine pointed out later, that products bearing the name of a prestigious prize become highly unstable in a period of cca 50 years, but little of this reassuring fact had I known back then. Instead, I took the tacklesack happily and we started our vigilant journey towards the centre of the globe. It soon became evident that the only way for being faster than my master would be to use gravity directly, without the unnecessary complication given by ropes, re-belays and so on. The main obstruction was a nasty wedging squeeze somewhere, which proved to be even worse on the way out. Finally, we reached the bottom, set up our magical set, murmured a couple of magic spells, and then woops, the boulder evaporated as if it had never been there! Indeed, it does help in exploration to read Harry Potter after all. We started to chisel our way further, but the rift got even narrower after a couple of meters, so we had to give up and started prussiking up. Again, my companion was nowhere to be seen until  I emerged completely exhausted at the bottom of Silos – where he waited half asleep, and noted that he is indeed quite cold. It was just the opposite for me. The rest of the trip continued in the same manner, and finally we emerged triumphantly at the surface. This was my first battle with Migovec, and so to say, I got completely addicted to the sweet smell of gunpowder.

## WATER!

It was one of the last pushing trips on the expo. Once again, we decided to go down to the unpassable rift at the bottom of M2 in order to find the Connection. This time, for sure, it was going to happen! Paul seemed to be as eager as I was, so we teamed up. At the same time, another party (Jarvist and Dan) was to go down to the “other side” of the rift, to hear our voices and then to shake hands, for sure. So we slowly worked our way down the many tight squeezes below Silos, and arrived at the – by then, familiar – small and cosy chamber. From here, the hammer and the chisel played the main role in our drama, or at least we thought so. It was not until a couple of hours later that we noticed that instead of the usual sound of water dripping into the pool, a steady, loud, constant noise is coming from the chamber. Squeezing back, we nervously looked at the stream of water dropping into the pool. Time to head out, as quick as possible! We threw some small flakes of the chocolate tinfoil to the stream in order to find it on the other side, hastily packed up, and started our way up, which turned out to be an ordeal. I wore a normal textile oversuit, which proved to be perfect for the cold water to directly run through, but Paul did not feel much better in his Meander either. The cave suddenly became like a wet Yorkshire cave, and soon we were completely soaked in the icy water. The flow became bigger and bigger, and our only hope was that from the top of Silos, the way should be dry, as we have never seen water there. Yet, once reaching the top, completely cold, exhausted, shivering, we had the worst sight in front of us: a 40 m high waterfall, the rope hopelessly dangling in the middle, with the majestic and frightening sound of water as it splashes at the rocks after its long freefall. At this point, there was no choice left: being as cold as we were, the survival bags would have been almost useless, and the water level seemed to rising, indicating that it is still raining on the surface, so did we decide to wait, it would have been at least half a day, resulting in hypothermia almost surely. We ate the last bits of chocolate we had, jumped, rubbed our arms to get some blood going, looked up into to dark, trying to estimate what is awaiting us. Neither of us was sure that we were going to make it. There was a ledge midway out of the water, so planned to go up there in one go, and the continue. Then, I clipped onto the rope. The jammers were in place, everything sorted out, feet in the footloop, bag on the back, rope as tight as possible. It was the moment to start. A wide swing took me directly in the middle of the water, and without thinking, I started prussiking as fast as I could. The force of the icy water seemed to be much stronger than my weak, half-frozen thighs, and it was hard to get any air, like being in the middle of a freezing icefall. I started swearing, knowing that I had to win. Seconds seemed minutes, and minutes hours, but finally I made it to the ledge. Paul could hardly hear the “rope free”, then he started up. I crossed my fingers and waited. The gigantic howling sound covered everything, the shouts of Paul went to thin air. Finally, he emerged with a frightened, completely pale face, blue lips, shivering, his hands are of almost no use at all. We hugged each other and jumped, trying to warm up. Then, the second half, just as bad as the first. When Paul showed up at the top, we smiled a bit: from here, we get out, even if we have to duck all the way! It was still a good couple of hours until we made it to the surface, about 6 hours after the callout. We dragged back to camp in the pouring rain, woke up Tetley, drank a bit of booze, and went for a massive 15 hour sleep – which was quite well earned after all.

## Trying to climb into M2. Incompetence, bravery and no luck.

Our main aim in 2008 was to discover the connection between M2 and Gardener's World, a feat which would heap honor on the shoulders of who discovered it. 2008 was my first year of caving in Slovenia and I was Very Keen. I dreamed of my shoulders baring the honor of the great discovery and did all I possibly could to be on the right trip at the right time. I took part in a few of the rigging trips down M2 and was amazed by alpine caving on Migovec: the huge huge pitches, the dry nature of the caving, could not wait for more “pushing”. At the time, the bivi rumour machine had determined the most likely way to find the connection was to explore the area around Kill'Em'All in Cpt Kangaroo. This side branch of Vrtnarija had been pushed the previous year by Rik and was infamous: uncharacteristically tight and twatty, rigged sparsely and badly, a total nightmare.

My first pushing trip in Cpt Kangaroo was with Clewin. The deeper you get into Captain K the more ridiculous the rigging was, with plenty of dodgy climbs waiting to dislocate your shoulder or break your ankle. The cherry on the cake was at the time Kill'Em'all, the most insane piece of rigging I have ever been exposed to. The pitch head is at the end of a tight rift. The original rigging consisted of a Y-hang in the main shaft, roughly half a meter below the entrance rift. The only way to get on the rope was to clip in and drop on the rope, possibly with a forward roll. The only way to get out was to clip the Y-hang with long cows tails, stand on the knot, wedge yourself into the rift and unclip. In retrospect criminally dangerous and terrifying, but at the time I thought this must be “expedition rigging” and took it in my stride. On the way out we bumped into Jarv and Paul who had rerigged large sections of the cave making it safer, by the end of the year the cave was more or less sensible. On that day Clewin and I pushed the main lead down, rigged two small pitches. I had my first taste of caving exploration and I loved it. Game on!

The trip with Clewin had already brought the bottom of the cave too deep for the expected position of the closest point to M2. I had somehow developed a reputation as a 'climber' and decided to have a go at climbing into a side passage at the top of Kill'Em'All. This required an easy slabby climb halfway up the pitch. We added a bolt half way down the pitch from which Gergely belayed me. In order to protect the climb I had some very long 8 mm rawl bolts, a rock pecker and a bunch of slings. I had had tried out the rock pecker on the surface, but found it much less easy to use whilst climbing, hammering away, the legs a bit weak with fear of falling, footholds feeling precarious in the big wellies, feeling I would knock myself off the wall... I bottled it, abandoned a very poor bolt, slung a sling around a spike and free climbed the short slab. A very easy climb (maybe Mod?) but nevertheless terrifying. I think that Gergely's singing helped a lot. At the time it felt like a great achievement. But it did not lead to the connection.

Climbing with a rock pecker was too scary. So next time Izi and I took an electric drill. It weighed a hell of a lot going through Captain K, but it would make cimbing the traverse above Primula a walk in the park. Unfortunately once arrived, the drill would not work. Bogus. Plan B: put in a spit and belay me across. This also failed, due to the rock being very rotten. Plan C: a natural for the belay and then free climb. While Izi slung some boulders and backed up to the rope above, I scoped the climb. Doable. There is a sort of foothold halfway but it is total commitment – a long step. The traverse was on the limit of the delicate climbing that can be done in full caving gear, I reached the rift at the far end of the traverse, wedged myself in and hammered the fastest spit I have ever placed. Once secure, I considered the way on. The rift was going slightly up and was totally blocked. No way on. But another crap inducing climb, and another step to make me less Keen!

The highlight of that years caving for me was actually a trip in the bottom of Captain K with Izi. On that trip we discovered Dark Tranquillity. It was the first proper pitch I pushed and the buzz was incredible. I remember sitting at the top discussing with Izi how it would rigged. I was apprehensive of screwing up, but he made it clear he trusted me.

Somehow the expedition ends. I am not upset at not having found the Connection. I am glad that I had some fun pushing trips. I am grateful I did not get hurt, or hurt my caving partners. I am proud of having another person trusting me. I am now a lot less Keen, know a thing or two about bivi rumours. But it would take a few more brocken drill carries to make me wizen up electrically!

## Raw Logbook Writeups

Typed by Jarv, 23-26th Dec 2011.

### Day 4 - Tuesday - James KP (by handwriting)

Andy & James KP: Set off at 1-ish to rerig Laurel. Got to the top of Laurel & found the ropes, but not maillons! Decided to walk back to bivvy & look for more. Having found none, we left for M2 to look for Clew & Dan & their stash of maillons. After a LONG search for M2, we reach M2 & start going thru loose meanders, constantly worried that we were going to shower Dan & Clew in rock fall. Eventually we get the maillons, walked back to GW, finally rig laurel. The second rope on Laurel is slightly worn & could do with changing (15-20m rope needed).

### Planika (Team JJ) - Jana

Rigged down the end of Rift and 1st Pitch in Planika. Pleasant surprise in the first chamber. The snow slope was quite melted next to the pitch wall, so we were able to go all the way down. We noticed way on and start smashing the ice wall. We felt the draft. We manage to get threw, but after few meter it's choked again with ice very close to wall. Back on the snow slope. On top we noticed that another melted way down formated. But need's bolting to get down. So we decided to continue the way. But not for long, because a lot of fresh snow blocked the way forward. After digging a bit threw it we decided that other route should be chosen for way on. We were very cold as well.

Back out, was still time, for me to chop and prepare some wood. Jarv walked down to Ravne to get some more stuff up.

### M2 - Dan & Clewin

After the obligatory morning faff in the bivvy we started off for M2, then turned back after 20 metres to get spits and cones. Wandered over to the entrance which is a stones throw from M18. The lower entrance drops into a gorgeous daylight shaft with a snow plug in the bottom and vast amounts of scree.

We then followed the obvious way on, which rapidly gets less and less obvious, turning into awkward rift. There are a fair few bits of free climbing before we spotted a piton. Not wanting to trust a 30 year old rusting bit of metal, we put in a couple of dodgy bolts, but also rigged off the piton. It was a straight drop, we just used a few metres of rope instead of one of the ladders we had. At the bottom is ever squeezy and awkward rift ending in a ladder drop (another new bolt). While doing this, Andy & James appeared, begging for maillons. We had far too many anyway, so we sent them off happy. At the end of the ladder drop, more rift and free climbs. The last climb we rigged with ladder before taking it off again since it didn't seem to buy us anything. Here it opens out into a reasonable, i.e. more than 2m, pitch. We put in two more bolts and then ran into trouble on the third. Dan bludgeoned the spit teath into a pukp and we spent about 10 minutes trying ingeneous ways to remove the duff spit from the driver. But we didn't want to do anything which would make it too difficult to remove if things went wrong. It was already 7:30 so we abandoned the mission.

### Cpt Kangaroo: Jana, James (Huggett?), Tetley

Easy down to Laurel. First rebelay under the boulder turned out to be too tight for our shorter members: add a long sling.

Down to Pico no problem, then to bonus chamber, scrotty would do with some mechanical enlarging. Down to traverse chamber. Left 20m of rope, 5x spit, maillon, hangers, cones. Rigged a free climb to mud slump (could be improved).

Jana: First trip for me down to Mud Slump. Lovely trip. It is actually not that scrotty - at least, not for me... :)
Pico is an amazing pitch. Will definitely return down there!

### 24.7.07 Jana

Jana, Jarv --> Planika

Went down and bolt in the first snow chamber to go down the new way, where the snow has melted. ~8m down in the snow tube hole. The way on was squizy and tight. A lot of draft coming up. We ran out of rope and bolts. it is still going. A bit tight. We surveyed on the way back --> total: new 24m down. Still need to go back and check the first pushing front from the last year (where) snow (cold chamber).

+ Tetley --> Come down later on

We almost finish rigging when we heard: "Is the rope free?" It was Tetley - he finally come down Planika. He want to down and take a look of a new go-go way. We mentioned that it is tight - and he was like "ye, ye..." But he get stuck in the first rift down. And in that position he light up a cigarette and smoke it :) On the way out we derigged, to use the yellow rope to rig down Monatip.

### 25-07-08 - E1 - Jarv

Jana & Jarv returned to E1, to investigate the possibilities...

Jana pushed the small crawl - draft, went for a while.

We then moved attention to the deep deep crawl, abandoned last year as dead. It wasn't. But perhaps it should have been. We moved the most dangerous boulder loitering over the edge & set to work.

Dig dig dig...

6m long, ~60deg to T scree slope, terminating in Pitch (6-8m by rattle).

First few armfuls of rock were stacked, until we started chucking scree over the edge, boom boom boom
Tidied back to bedrock --- too tight --- damn! Strange pitchead, almost T-shaped: water slopping over the edge, but also a notch cut down (~10cm wide).

E1: We surf surveyed & tied into M2 - 40m above the end of goodybag, M16
Need a better name before it gets too big → 'Mountain Goat Cave'? Sounds good in Slovene, says Jana.

### 25-7-08 Planika → EchoRift

Dropped new melted pitch. Safe rock → awful rope rub. Meh. 1 bolt & down, comedy sling backup & pitch rope stretched across. Pushed to tight chest-wide rift; ice everywhere. Tight rift meandered to pitchhead. Located natural hang while Jana fetched survey kit & rope. 1 dodgy thread & down. Long sling to stretch out rope (~8m). This proved troublesome on the way up. Dropped onto ice-floored chamber with semi-tight rift off it. 1.5m diam hole to small chamber 4m below. Even tighter rift in same dirn. from here. Surveyed out carefully.

Just the otherside of the chest squeeze, Tetley shouted down, having taken the hyper death slide across the snow. He tried the chest squeeze, got wedged & so cracked out his smoke kit & had a tab.

### 24/7 M2 Rigging Part 2 - Clewin

Dan & Clewin: Started where we left off --- with 2 ½ bolts placed at the top of the first real pitch. Dan finished off the last bolt and so we abseiled down. Using the rope from the pitch I climbed up from the bottom to see if there was a way on at a high level. There wasn't, but the aven looks promising, although would require a proper climbing trip. The bottom of the pitch leads to a 40m pitch. There was a 70s piton for backup and a spit at the pitchead. We used the spit (not _too_ rusty) and put a new spit to give a Y-hang. 30m down was a wide ledge with garbage from the 70s.

[Side track] Off the ledge was a small rift leading to a drop which we rigged with a ladder. Below that a dodgy free climb lead to a nice section of wide rift passage with a stream at the bottom and a red survey dot on the wall. This all closed up completely, so we derigged the ladder.

At the bottom of the 40m (Kletnikov Skropilnik) a tight rift of black rock lead to the next pitch. There were no pitchead bolts so we left this for another trip.
Clewin.

### 26/7 Fratnik & James: 3rd Rig of M2

Continued where we left: Andrej rigged M2: safely 1st rebelay on a giant (minibus sized) boulder of dubious stability. 2hrs + 5 rebelays later we were 20m from the bottom & out of spits. Damn! Return with 5+ bolts and finish the job some other day. Had a hell of a time getting out of the entrance rift...

## 26/7 Jarv & Clew → Planika

Ill fated trip! The rerig slowed us down. Clew placed a Y-hang bolt - went a bit deep, no matter - "I have a cunning plan". Wedging a spare cone lightly into the spit, he protected the thread while cleaning around. Of course, it didn't come out again. Then he hit a super tight Alpine-butterfly just 1m shy of the rebelay. 20 mins of effort, to prussic up & have Jarv knaw it open.
Then he lost his knife in a crevass & spent 20 thoroughly cold minutes digging it out, while Jarv placed the backup bolt (nice white soft rock). Expanded the chest squeeze & finally reached the pushing front rather late. Clew expanded the pre-pitch squeeze while Jarv rerigged & then attempted the higher, better rift.

Rift: Phreatic top slightly less than body crawl sized tube, less than chest width vadose. But transition zone is very friable. I got ~3m in, to see 2m rift → chamber. Drafting _IN_. Chamber has fist sized boulders in it. Turns right.

GOING!!!* (* with instr. of destruction)

### 26/7/08 - Vilinksa Jama (AKA Tetley's mysterious lead). Tetley, Dan, Bozo & Janet (Guard).

Tetley led the way down past GW. Only grudgingly agreeing that blind folds would not be required. The entrance is an unwelcoming yet strangely inviting scree slope under a bedding plane, with a howling and glacial draft emerging from it.

We headed down, leaving Janet at the surface to see off any would-be unsurpers of the joys within. The way on quickly opens up to a chamber with a snow plug then regresses just as quickly to a tight, boulder filled, rift. Tetley started chisseling away at a constriction. Dan took over while Tetley dug underneath, bypassing the squeeze entriely. More up & down around the boulders led to an impassably tight pitch head. Tetley & Dan made slow progress with chisels until Bozo arrived, having extracted our location from Janet. A few mighty blows later, the way on was clear (still tight though - will need more destruction).

Tetley rigged a ladder from a securely wedged boulder, and Dan clambered down into a boulder strewn chamber. Water was dripping from a crack in the ceiling, and the rift continued ahead.
"Does it go?" shouted Tetley
"Game on!" came the reply.

Bozo forged ahead, quickly finding another chamber, filled with a vast two way boulder slope. Up and over choked quickly. Down and under was precarious in the extreme, but Tetley's careful proress under the hanging death and down a short climb yielded the next pitch. A ~20m drop into a large fault controlled chamber. With no SRT kit or rope we made our exit, pausing briefly to discuss potential names. We settled on Vilinksa Jama (Veela cave) and returned to the Bivi for Tea & Medals.

### 26.07.08 - Andy & Jana → M16 → Plopzilla → End of NCB (Zebra)

10 hour trip. Re-rigged the way down to Gladiators. Also re-rigg a small traverse just after club mig.

Jana had an epic piss on the ledge in the middle of Gladiators.

We check out Plop, but have not taken the rope out.

Checked the end of NCB. In Zebra, 2 ways on:
* A small climb down (~6m) need to be smashed, remove boulders
* Small, tight crawl cont. up Zebra

Have taken the Gladiator's old rope out.
Amazing trip!

### 28.07.08  Jana & Jarv → Surface Work
1) Went back to Valley 8 (next one to B9), you can see loads of cave entrances. Check out. But only one goes. You climb down under the boulder choke, turn right down to a small chamber. From here there are at least 2 ways on. They both need stones removed. All to be done very gently and carefully since so many boulders hang on top. Looking good to go.

2) Behind M19 have noticed a small cave entrance. A slope down to a chamber visible. Did not go down, since at that time I was alone. Put a cairn to mark an entrance.

3) East of M19 possibly next to M15? There is a big entrance. We climbed down and digged (a bit) 3 possible routes on. Quite drafty. On to the bottom way on(?) we noticed that someone might have used a hammer. You can feel a lot of cold draft. Digging, smashing, needed but it does look very good to go!
[ JCC GPS Waypoint 1851m N46.25311 E013.7610 ]

4) Loads of big (deep) entrances just behind the bivi. Almost of them have snow at the bottom. Rope needed to explore!

5) Re-discover the Royston Vasey (we believe?) re located. Look at Hollow Mountain page 147.

6) Re-discover, located a cave entrance with a red spot in front. It starts with a narrow pitch down. Next to red spot it is an old bolt as well. It is just further on on the right up from Royston Vasey, looking towards kuk. Worth going back down again. [We believe this is Dave Wilson's 1996 Dig]

### 30-07-08 Jana, Andy, Janet → Surface Work

GPS'ed all the caves big holes begind bivy. Re-checked all the Ms (GPS: M1, M16, M18, M4, M15, M17, M19)

GPS'ed new? entrances, starting with letter A, A1-A4.

All A worth to go down and take a look. Bolting needed!

### 29.7.08 - Intravenus de Milo - a diatribe - Clewin

After plenty of trips down M2, it was time to push the other side of the mythical GW-M2 connection. James KP & I caved down to traverse chamber, past Captain Kangaroo. Originally I thought that the GW side would be more pleasant than M2, but then the repressed memories of Captain Kangaroo resurfaced as the passageway turned into a succession of horrible squeezes, horrible climbs and horrible pitcheads.

Traversing across Traverse Chamber and into Mud Slump, the cave quality declined somewhat, decaying into crumbling climbs and pitches which had been rigged off a dodgy natural, half way down. We pushed on, hoping to find a PSS with "Kill 'em All" written on it. Eventually we did. Relief was rapidly followed by shock and despair when James crawled around the corner and saw the Kill 'em All pitchhead. To paraphrase: This is by far and away, and without a shadow of a doubt the worst and most contemptible pitchead you'll ever see. He wasn't far off. Schematically it looked something like this: (diagram)
Coming up would certainly be a problem, but we were going to be exiting via M2 through the as-yet-undiscovered connection, so we didn't consider that eventuality.

Compared with the unspeakable Mud Slump, the cave at the bottom of Kill 'em All pitch was actually quite nice. There was a climb down near the bottom of the pitch which we attempted, before the dawning realisation that rescue after a fall here would be pretty much impossible. So we rigged off a natural and dropped to the floor. I sat and smirked as James struggled to get even his helmet through the miniscule rift at the bottom. So that lead was dead. We derigged and turned our attention to the only other way on, the rift leading south from the bottom of the pitch. The rift zigzagged left then right and we climbed up into a round window on the right.

This lead to a small pitch. I belayed James down and he found a rift at the bottom leading to a pitch with a "5 second" drop. He then revised that down to 4 sec. I'd suggest 35m (maybe 2 ½ sec). I put a bolt in and dropped down so we could survey out.

The Intravenus de Milo pitch looked really pretty, with horizontal blades of rock jutting out at various levels. By the time we had finished surveying, we were running short of time -- 4 hours to our call out. The way out was fairly desparate, with me getting stuck on climbs and James stuck in squeezes. No one bit of cave was truly awful, but the combined effect of 3 solid hours of unrelenting scrot of the purest variety on the way out started to sap my will to live. Having grit in my wetsocks grinding away at my toes didn't improve the experience. Still, got out with 2 mins to go before our callout.

Back in the Bivvy, superb slop and trifle for desert was really appreciated. Shockingly, despite my recounting tales of squallor, 4 people were eager to go down the next day. Such is the lure of exploration I guess.

### 29-7-08 Planika - hard ^echo^ rift push

Jarv, Paul, Jana (written by Jarv)

Straight to echo rift & started hammering (no lump, only bolt hammer).
4hrs later w/ Bob Dylan blaring, after a few tries with oversuit I stripped to wet socks, furry & safety hat (acrylic). I got my feet into the chamber beyond up to my feet, but couldn't commit to not breathing as I pushed past.

(Diagram)

You know it's desperate when your wet socks freeze to the ground as you get ready.

Problem is the S-bend nature of the rift. And my refusal to go headfirst.

On way out, we derigged to first rebelay & climbed into scary rift: "Diggers of the U.G.". Loose boulders everywhere, above extension Meander which forms lowest rebelay. BUT, off to the left is a strongly blowing chamber through tight, but hammerable , rift.

## Plopzilla - Photo Trip Writeup - Jarv

Andy's last trip; so it had to be Plop.

Set off with a Daren drum of gear, Paul in the lead & with Andy bringing up the rear
(Ooh-err!)
Took a few firefly digi shots coming up into hotline. Seems to be lots off the lower M16 ent. pitches - Lost City & etc. ?
More photos on the newly SEXY gladiator's rigging, then shot off up Faulty Towers. Popped into NCB; Andy conned us into pissing down Silos:- "Don't piss in the main passage, climb down there but no further than the first bolt!"

Rerigged traverse in NCB (more photos!), then to the main game: Plop.
We had a plan, I asbeiled down with gear & scrambled up a slope. Pitch head was 'interesting' [clip in cows, push through squeeze & swing out above 105m hoping cows were still in].
Rebelays were 'interesting' [so tight, one had to climb above belay to derig descender].
Knot change 'exciting' [knot a 'Rik Special', 9mm below super slippery]
Gear down there 'intriguing' [explains where all the rope went -- 90m 11mm, 90m 9mm & 1 tacklesac ]

Tried our best on 2 attempts @ film exp, a few digis, then dived into the Boulder choke. Went down -30m or so, drips, went through a lot of very loose Boulders then into bigger stones, but with solid wall, lots of Boulders. Many drips, no stream hearable. Otherwise very similar to Jelly Chamber. Got as far as a loose committing climb into a large-ish chamber.

It goes, it really does. But I'm not going there. Stones rattled ~4s.

Climbed ridge to corner & found another entry to choke.

So we left & derigged. Rope → Club Mig.
Sped out once, gear stashed. 2hrs from bot. Fawlty Towers.

## Dangermouse - Izi, Paul, Jarv - by Jarv

\begin{verse}

\end{verse}
\attrib{Dangermouse}

With a load of food & bolts, we shot down to Something Fishy & dived down the right crawl. Drafting, with deep sand floor (all spoiled!). Became rather tight after ~7m.

So we hit the pitch, belay off jammed boulder, soon with a bolt.

Paul & Izi set off to grab the 2nd bolt kit. Hopped down 2nd pitch (6m) and came to something seemingly identical. Rigged off obvious natural & dropped down to choosy shelf ~8m. Then I turned around. Small pitch it was not. Boulders banged for 6s+.
Water could be heard a long way down, nothing visible [not even a drip!]. The way to the M2 confluence?

From -25m (limit), one could peer down past cascades into... blackness. Big chamber?

Left ~50m of 10mm at last bolt, PSS on sticking-out ledge + bolt kit. & 2nd bolt kit at head of Something Fishy.

Early exit ~1AM.

We blew trumpets every hour & listened every x 30minutes - nothing from the M2 crew.

## Slop Kaboom

1) Into a pressure cooker put some Tuna, soya mince, chilli paste, tomato puree, dried onion and water
2) Leave cooking and go to sunset spot, have a few glasses of wine
3) Let of some of the steam and take the pressure cooker off the heat
4) Slowly try to turn the handles - if it won't go de pressurise more
5) Get fed up with this depressurising process and then force open the cooker
 --- KABOOM ---
6) Slop is instantly served in the Bivi - dinner can be got from all the surfaces - tarps, rocks and the chef.

Safety Advice:
* Listen to Janet's comment from last year log book
* Lost the weight from the cooker
* Do NOT try this at home / bivvy
* Wash down the bivvy afterwards

## Dangermouse Continued - Martin, Tim, Paul, Jarv - 9th Aug - by Martin

Despite being on several expeditions I have managed to always find somewhere else to go caving, but despite memories of Rik & Marcin's exploration of CK I was lulled into going down to Dangermouse. On the way down CK it was noticeable that there is a certain lack of quality rigging - reminding me of the early Ben's Crap Lead rigging. Bonus chamber could do with a traverse line before you swing out over the pitch. The near two sections of the cave Scrotty and Even Scrottier again with a few hours of bashing and reshaping could change the passage to something nearer normal type passage.

At Dangermouse I headed down to Jarv's bolt and set about clearing the pitch. Several large boulders were pushed down to a large resounding boom and crack of shattering rocks. From the first bolt I continued the gardening to a large natural in a corner. Paul followed on down, and then Jarv. From the natural we descended via one bolt to a window. A small moment of disco leg occured when a large chunk of the wall came off as I stood on it.

Paul came down to the window and took over the bolting. Eventually, after the first attempt broke the wall we had a bolt. I then sent / volunteered Paul to traverse over the pitch head to a possible rift / alcove. Unfortunately it turned out to be an alcover, so after a quick piss Paul returned, and went down the pitch to the bottom. He declared it dead & I followed as far as a ledge above, then Jarv went to the bottom for his compulsory photo op. Finally Tim joined us. While waiting on Jarv to finish his photography I started to throw stones down a small squeeze.

From beyond the squeeze a resounding boom could be heard. So quickly the rope was pulled up leaving Jarv and Paul stranded below and Tim went down. Unfortunately he faced the wrong way and could not turn his head to see down the pitch. Putting my stop on my cowstails I descended for a quick look. After the squeeze the cave opens out into a chamber.

So while Paul and Jarv surveyed out Tim placed his first bolt and rigged the descent. A first for CK we backed up the descent a figure of eight to a bolt and then an alpine butterfly onto a sling round a natural. All of this beautiful rigging was executed by Tim. So we made quick visit to the continuation and can confirm it is going somewhere.

Further Thoughts: We need a demolition team to visit Scrotty and hammer, beat it into shape.

## Scrotty Bashing - Martin, Paul, Tim

After the last trip, it was quite clear that the passages in Captain Kangaroo needed some alterations. So over a few drinks and the fire I talked about the possible home improvements we could make. The idea of bashing the shite out of scrotty seemed to appeal to lots of people, no doubt motivated by the idea of getting something back on the annoying part of the cave.

So Paul, Tim & I set out armed with two hammers and chisels, as well as some tatty rope for the climbs in the cave. We were quickly down at the start of Captain Kangaroo and we then set about bashing the passage. We took a cycling approach to the task with one person taking the head of the peleton with the large hammer, then the second person refining the passage with the smaller hammer and finally the third person 'resting' at the rear.

At Bonus chamber, Paul & I rigged a traverse line, so you no longer have to swing off the pitch whilst unprotected. On the same vein we made several improvements to the handlines. The only one pitch that we could not improve was the one that the the backup was below the main bolt. I had removed the backup with the idea that on the way out we could rebolt it with the kit left in Olympic Rift.

Anyway after redecorating scrotty we listened to Bob and then headed down for the kit left by Rik in 2007. We quickly descended the pitches below Traverse Chamber. It was quite clear from the offset that this was not the normal Rik Venn rigging. It was a delight to go down pitches with traverse lines, backups and other aspects of which would pass for standard rigging from Alpine Caving Techniques. Well down we went and it soon became clear that we were still in the Scrotty series according to PSS left by Clewin. At the bottom there was a rift going off - was this the Olympic Rift? After a few twists and turns it was quite clear that this rift was very tight and we were fed up with this shit. Paul had a quick look around the corner to check that the rift continued in the same shit manner and then we got the feck out of there.

Overall there is a new improve scrotty, but we have no idea where Rik's lead is from last year. Maybe looking at the survey will solve this problem.
