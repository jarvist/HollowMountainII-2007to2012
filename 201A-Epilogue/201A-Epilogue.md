# Epilogue

For our purposes, the story ends with the 2012 expedition. 
The two main systems on Migovec connected by a happenstance trip.

The exploration does not end here. 
Every year, Tolminski Migovec sees new generations cut their teeth on the exploration possible in the Hollow Mountain. 
New people and new techniques produce new discoveries. 
Predicting how the next five or ten years exploration will go is utterly impossible.

But whether it is ourselves (ICCC and the JSPDT) or peoples many hundred years hence, I'm sure someone will be interested in exploring the depths of this mountain, and I hope that this documentation, patchy, flawed and incomplete as it inevitably is, is of some assistance to your exploration.
