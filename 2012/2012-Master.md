# 2012 --- Sledi Vetra

## Abstract

Sledi Vetra 2012 was a clear success. 2703m of new cave passage was found, the majority of which below -600m, once again using Camp X-Ray at -550m as a base. The main discoveries in Vrtnarija include: the Watership Down series below Daydreamers, adding 12m of depth to the cave and taking it to -900m; about 1km of horizontal development below Stuck in Paradise (-700m); and the Apollo extensions leading off a bolt climb in the Queen’s Bedchamber. The Apollo extensions also ended up connecting to Waterloo in System Migovec, giving us the long sought after connection and tying in ~15 years of exploration by ICCC on Migovec. System Migovec is now 25592m long , 973m deep and has the distinction of being the longest cave in Slovenia. 

## Introduction

Between 13th July and 19th August 2012, Imperial College Caving Club had twenty-six members participate in the Sledi Vetra (Follow the Wind) 2012 expedition to Tolminski Migovec, Slovenia.
 
There were two major aims for this expedition. One was the continued exploration of Vrtnarija, where considerable efforts in 2010 and 2011 had led to the discovery of 4.4km of mainly horizontal passage, all below 500 m in depth. The other was to connect Vrtnarija with Sistem Migovec (SysMig), which ICCC first started exploring in 1994, thus forming the longest cave system in Slovenia. At the start of the expedition, Vrtnarija was 11025 m long and 888 m deep, and the smallest separation between Kavkna Jama (M2 entrance in SysMig) and Vrtnarija was 4 m (±30 m survey error).
 
In addition, an enduring desire to understand the caves of Migovec meant that surface work in Areas K, S and N (north of Kuk) was also a major consideration during the expedition.
 
A large and strong UK team, and a longer-than-usual expedition (five weeks instead of four) meant that we had sufficient manpower and time to achieve all expedition aims.
 
As in previous expeditions (’03, ’10, ’11), an underground camp (Camp X-Ray) was set up at -550 m in Vrtnarija to facilitate further exploration of the deep leads. Eighteen people from the UK and six Slovenes from the local JSPDT club spent nights at X-Ray for a total of 90 people-nights. This included three first-year cavers, all of whom contributed significantly to exploration. All but one pushing trips were done on overnight camps, with almost all successful exploration occurring below 500m.
 
Three separate trips were made to Kavkna Jama in an attempt to forge the connection between SysMig and Vrtnarija. Though an acoustic connection was made when parties sent down Captain Kangaroo in Vrtnarija could hear the sound of drilling and hammering occurring in Kavkna Jama, the actual physical connection was elusive. Somewhat unexpectedly, the connection was instead made in a completely separate area of the cave when Dreams for the Soul, a phreatic passage off Queen's Bedchamber in Vrtnarija, dropped into Waterloo in SysMig (all at ~-600 m).
 
Aided by perfect weather for much of the expedition, surface work was carried out by cavers in between underground camps. Most of it was concentrated in Areas K and N. Two pitches were dropped in N9 (a.k.a. Kuk Pot), with the continuation visible but hampered by a lack of time. Entrances K2, K… were also re-visited. K2 remains the most promising, while digging went on in K19.
 
In all we discovered 2703 m of new cave passage taking Vrtnarija to 13728 m long and 900 m deep. Thanks to the connection, the combined System Migovec is now 25592 m long and 973m deep, with the deepest point being Watership Down in Vrtnarija, found during this year’s expedition. This makes SysMig the longest cave system in Slovenia, displacing the famous Postojna Jama as the previous record holder at 20190m. 
Cave Discoveries

Our major cave finds this year are described as these separate developments within Tolminski Migovec:


## Winter Action

In October 2011, a joint effort by ICCC and JSPDT was made to forge the connection. While the connection was ultimately unsuccessful, important survey work of recent years’ efforts in Kavkna Jama clearly showed which part of Kavkna was closest to Vrtnarija. As a result, the focus of exploration shifted from the bottom of Kavkna to Wizard of Oz, a bolt climb at -350m that was pushed in 2009.
 
In the months between the October weekend and the start of the Sledi Vetra expedition, the JSPDT had multiple pushing trips at Wizard of Oz. The silted rift was dug through and widened to gain a fairly large, clean chamber with no obvious way on. A small passage about 3m from the floor was expanded into yet more narrow and muddy crawls, eventually ending in a smaller chamber. Once again, easy progress was hampered by an extremely tight crawl. 

## Vrtnarija / M2 (Kavkna Jama)

Three ‘connection’ trips were carried out during the expedition. On the first two attempts,  simultaneous trips were run to Capt Kangaroo in Vrtnarija and Wizard of Oz in Kavkna. Unfortunately, progress past the tight crawl in Wizard of Oz proved elusive as expanding it was slow work. However, on both occasions teams in Vrtnarija were able to hear the sounds of the Kavkna team drilling and hammering.
 
On the final attempt, the 8m crawl in Wizard of Oz was passed. The passage enlarges into an immature rift but closes down almost immediately with silt and mud flakes, without any sort of draught. About midway through the crawl there seemed to be a very slight draught coming from a small hole in the floor, though any pushing here would require considerable effort spent digging.  

## Watership Down

Watership Down is the continuation of Winter Journey, a system of abandoned bedding planes at -888m in Vrtnarija. Two pushing trips were carried out to explore rabbit warren-like system of crawls and chambers. From the Winter Journey pushing front, a series of steeply inclined bedding planes covered with a thick inch layer of mud were passed to gain a beautiful, clear static sump. Opposite the sump a passage leads off into a tight rift which was not pushed to its end; it is most likely a dead inlet.  

More interestingly, obvious traverses and windows above the sump were gained to find another crawl which ended above yet another static sump.
 
There are still undropped pitches and windows to be looked at in Watership Down, though it is unlikely more depth will be added.
 
A total of 140.96 m of passage was found in Watership Down, adding 12 m of depth to Vrtnarija.  

## Below 'Stuck in Paradise'

At the end of the 2011 expedition, Stuck in Paradise (P69, -680 m) was dropped and two branches of extensive horizontal passage, Salvation and Lost Miles, were found below it. The possibility of more horizontal development at depth made the pushing of Salvation and Lost Miles a high priority.
Salvation
The squeeze left at the end of Salvation was hammered and dug through to gain a small chamber with a roaring draught (Brave New World). The way on down was blocked by a big boulder choke; instead, a carefully dug hole was followed upwards into sloping, crawling passage that enlarges to walking height. Eventually, the passage breaks into an active streamway, with the downstream passage taking the draught.
 
The downstream passage leads to an obvious phreatic continuation, which was blocked by a collapsed ceiling. This boulder choke was eventually squeezed through after two trips to reach 70 m of fine sandy passage (Invictus). This ends in a wet pitch (~P20) that was left unpushed.
 
172.4 m of mostly horizontal passage was found in the Salvation extensions.  

## Lost Miles

At the end of the 2011 expedition, Lost Miles was left as a draughting boulder choke. This year, we managed to chisel and hammer our way through, immediately breaking out into a large chamber and storming passage (Atlantis). After about 100 m a junction was reached with three ways on: continuation of the passage ahead, a turning to the right, and a pitch through a hole in the floor.
 
The pitch was dropped, but leads almost immediately to a boulder choke that looks promising but needs work (Inglourious Basterd).
 
The passage the right leads to about 250 m of easy caving (Minestrone), with occasional bouts of stooping and crawling. It eventually ends in a small chamber, with the way on being a low crawl blocked by rubble, though there is a draught. However, a subsequent digging trip to get past the blockage was unsuccessful, and any further progress would require considerable effort.
 
The continuation of Atlantis led to more walking passage. Most exciting was the discovery of a gallery of speleothems, including a vast array of helictites, stalactites, stalagmites and columns. This is probably the most decorated bit of cave we have found on Migovec thus far - certainly the highest concentration of stal.
 
Atlantis eventually becomes blocked with boulders in a low-roofed passage. Straight on there is a tight squeeze through which the continuation of the passage is visible. This was unpushed. Instead, a squeeze under boulders on the right was passed to reach a small, dry muddy tube that popped into a small chamber. The way on is a 10m flat-out crawl, accompanied by the sound of water. The crawl emerges in a chamber at the bottom of a pitch, with a large waterfall entering from above. This was thus named Brezno Slapov (literally ‘waterfall pitch’).
 
A series of short cascades followed; exploration was eventually halted by the need for rope.
 
A total of 757.15 m of passage was found beyond Lost Miles.
 
Interestingly, these waterfall pitches found at the end of Brezno Slapov and Invictus are the first signs of water and active passage since Zimmer. 

## Apollo & the Milky Way

In 2011, an attempt at a bolt climb to gain a window in the Queen's Bedchamber was derailed by bands of thick, slippery mud preventing the successful installation of bolt belays. This year, armed with tent pegs to hammer into the mud as temporary belays, three pushing trips were required to conquer the bolt climb (Apollo, P35).
 
At the top of the climb a muddy, downward-sloping passage leads to a short pitch which lands in a large chamber. The passage on the right leads to a dead end; the way on is through a short bedding crawl on the left.
 
The crawl quickly widens into a small chamber with two ways on. Straight ahead is easy but muddy caving, eventually leading to a pitch which we suspect drops back into the Queens Bedchamber. On the right is a long horizontal passage, mostly requiring easy crawling or stooping (Milky Way). At the end of this passage is a clean-washed chamber that joins a split-pitch midway. A high, wet aven drops into the chamber; the water then disappears under boulders. A way through the boulder floor is obvious and easy, leading to a pitch. On a subsequent trip this pitch was dropped but not surveyed.  
 
Midway through Milky Way is a turning off to the left, heading south-west. This was pushed for about 70 m to a boulder choke that was easily passed. Following the draught for about 50 m, a 20 m high rift was eventually reached; this rift is most likely the continuation of the Minotaur/Guillotine rift in Vrtnarija.
 
From the rift, a horizontal, crystal-covered phreatic passage continues South-West, heading directly towards System Migovec. The phreatic seems to have multiple levels, as it was sometimes possible to see empty space between the boulders below.
 
A couple of climbs later, a ~30 m wet pitch was reached. A bigger dark space could be seen across the pitch, so a traverse line was rigged. After 3 m of traversing, a bolt placed by cavers in 1998 was found. Across the traverse lay a large chamber (~20 m wide) in the middle of which a PSS was found: Waterloo 13, 6/8/98/, JE/IMcK. On the last pushing day of the expedition, the connection to System Migovec was finally made! The passage was named Dreams for the Soul.
 
703.46 m of cave was found in the Apollo extensions. 

## The Throne Room

At the end of 2011 expedition there were two unpushed leads in the Throne Room: a pitch, and a window across it. The pitch (Why the face?) was dropped. The crawl below it leads immediately to a draughting pitch, which was also dropped but the passage below it quickly choked.
 
The traverse was bolted across to the window and up a steeply inclined, very loose boulder slope (Hot Pants). From the top of the traverse is a short climb up the slope and through a boulder choke to a fairly impressive chamber about 7 m high. A sandy tube goes from the edge of the chamber, blowing out; it is fairly committing and was left unpushed this expedition.
 
Two further trips were made to bolt climb up to the window in the chamber and push the passage beyond. This climb reached a ledge in the chamber, which gained parallel passage trending downwards at 30 degrees and pushed for 70 m (Peep Show).
 
Returning to the ledge, the upwards continuation (Undercover Squirrel) was pushed for 70 m up a couple of free climbs. Exploration was halted as a modest bolt climb was required to progress.
 
The area in general is of interest due to its location in the far North-East of the known cave passage - it is possible that it may access more 'deep level' galleries such as were discovered 300 m to the West within the mountain in 2003 and 2004.
 
281.61 m of passage was found in the leads off The Throne Room.

## Other Leads

### Xanadu

Xanadu is a new and exciting lead found in 2012. It starts from a nondescript hole in the floor in Friendship Gallery, a mere 5 minutes from Camp X-Ray en route to Big Rock Candy Mountain. Surprisingly, no one explored it in the 9 years since we first camped at X-Ray!
 
The climb down through the hole immediately leads to an interesting rift with different levels. At the bottom (~30 m below Friendship Gallery) is an active stream. Upstream was pushed to a wet squeeze, downstream ended in a sump.
 
However, the most promising way on is midway down the rift, where it is possible to gain a muddy, wet tube. Through this tube the character of the cave changes completely, with dry, muddy passage (Euphrates) instead of the clean-washed white rock of before. At the end of the muddy passage is a strongly draughting pitch.
 
Initial attempts to descend the pitch proved unsuccessful due to the poor quality of rock. The pitch remains undescended and is an exciting lead for 2013.  

86.69 m was found in Xanadu.

### Yorkshire

Yorkshire is the continued exploration along a narrow rift above an active waterfall at the bottom of the Lower Pleasures series, which was explored in 2011.
 
Initial narrow rift gives way to a squeeze above 2 m hole, which is followed by another squeeze into a small chamber. Turning left from the chamber quickly led to tight constriction from which an active stream enters and exits to the right. Turning right led to more narrow rift, which drops into a small pool of water after 8m. A stream, which enters the pool from the left, was followed downstream for another 30 m before a dried mud junction was discovered at higher level.
 
The streamway continued further, but this was not surveyed.
 
The 2012 exploration of Yorkshire found 91.18 m of passage, most of which gently sloped northward, in parallel to Highway 32, 35 m below. 

### Minotaur Rift

The squeeze left at the far end of Minotaur Rift in the 2010 expedition was pushed to difficult crawling passage, often awkward with loose, sharp rocks. The rift continues along the same fault line as in Minotaur rift. A series of boulder chokes make progress interesting, including one which involves squeezing past a sharp rock, precariously wedged above one’s head (Guillotine).
 
After Guillotine is a very tight and sharp flat out crawl, sloping slightly downwards. The passage eventually pops out into the larger chamber. On inspection it proved to be a very big open fault (Razor). Looking up, a higher level can be observed. The way on continues down a small pitch and a further two climbs down. Unfortunately, the rift at the end gets too narrow to follow.
 
174.41 m was added to Minotaur rift.

### Stagger Lee

In 2011, a window off the side of Big Rock Candy Mountain was spotted. Stagger Lee is the continuation of this window located 17 m above the floor of Big Rock. A high traverse was set up from the second last hanger. It was followed by a 15 m abseil and another 5 m traverse through falling water to gain the window.
 
Following the right hand side of the wall led to a series of cascading drops (P35m) that ended on the floor of the twin shaft. Here, two streams combined into one active streamway beneath boulder-filled chamber.
 
The streamway continued for a further 14 m before dropping 10 m into a horizontal streamway which was later discovered to be the mouth of Soda Stream, killing interest in future exploration in this chamber. Nonetheless a side window heading in the general direction of  Balamory was spotted 4m from the bottom.  
 
A total of 145.01 m of passage was found in Stagger Lee, part of which was a resurvey of Soda Stream. 

## Surface Work

Aided by perfect weather for much of the expedition, surface work was carried out by cavers in between underground camps. Most of it was concentrated in Areas K and N. Two pitches were dropped in N9 (Kuk Pot), with the continuation visible but hampered by a lack of time.
 
Entrances K2, K6, K11, K22, K21, K23, K24, K25, and K26 were also revisited. K22, K24, K25 did not seem at all promising. Good progress was made digging K6. Of the remainder, K2 seems to have the most potential, though all need a lot of work before the cave ¡goes¢. 

### Accidents

No significant accidents or missed callouts occurred during Sledi Vetra 2012.

## Prospect for 2013

Despite the success of the 2012 expedition, it is clear that there remains a large amount of cave to be discovered in Vrtnarija and Migovec. In Vrtnarija, the obvious areas to focus our attention on include: the descent of the wet pitches at the end of Brezno Slapov and Invictus, pushing the rift at the end of Milky Way, further exploration of Xanadu and Lower Pleasures, various unpushed leads in Watership Down at the bottom, and a second bolt climb to a window at Queens Bedchamber that seems to be the continuation of the horizontal development found in Milk Way. Furthermore, as we now have the necessary know-how and equipment to bolt climb, there are various ¡deep¢ leads to revisit from the 2003 expedition such as Strap on the Nitro. 

In some ways, we have the fortunate problem of almost being too successful in recent years, as the leads are now fairly spread out and getting further from camp each year. This year, it was common for pushing trips to Watership Down and Invictus/Atlantis to take upwards of 21 hours. Nonetheless, Camp X-Ray remains the most likely camp due to its central location and easy access to water -- however, an additional lightweight 2 man camp nearer to the more remote locations is a strong possibility. 

Thanks to the connection there are also old leads in the old SysMig that are worth revisiting, especially around the Waterloo area. 

In October 2012, on the annual ICCC/JSPDT ¡winter action¢ weekend, a breakthrough was made in Primadonna, another cave system on mountain. Due to its close proximity to the System, this will be the next big ¡connection¢ project in our bid to shed more light on the complex subterranean system under Migovec.
