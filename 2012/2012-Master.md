# 2012 --- Sledi Vetra

## Abstract

Sledi Vetra 2012 was a clear success. 
2703 m of new cave passage was found, the majority of which below -600 m, once again using Camp *X-Ray* at -550 m as a base. 
The main discoveries in *Vrtnarija* include: the *Watership Down* series below Daydreamers, adding 12 m of depth to the cave and taking it to -900 m; about 1 km of horizontal development below *Stuck in Paradise* (-700 m); and the *Apollo* extensions leading off a bolt climb in the *Queen's Bedchamber*. 
The *Apollo* extensions also ended up connecting to *Waterloo* in System Migovec, giving us the long sought after connection and tying in \textasciitilde 15 years of exploration by ICCC on Migovec. 
System Migovec is now 25592 m long, 973 m deep and has the distinction of being the longest cave in Slovenia. 


## Introduction

Between 13th July and 19th August 2012, Imperial College Caving Club had twenty-six members participate in the Sledi Vetra \sidenote{Follow the Wind} 2012 expedition to Tolminski Migovec, Slovenia.
 
There were two major aims for this expedition. 
One was the continued exploration of *Vrtnarija*, where considerable efforts in 2010 and 2011 had led to the discovery of 4.4 km of mainly horizontal passage, all below 500 m in depth. 
The other was to connect *Vrtnarija* with Sistem Migovec (SysMig), which ICCC first started exploring in 1994, thus forming the longest cave system in Slovenia. 
At the start of the expedition, *Vrtnarija* was 11025 m long and 888 m deep, and the smallest separation between *Kavkna Jama* (*M2* entrance in SysMig) and *Vrtnarija* was 4 m (±30 m survey error).
 
In addition, an enduring desire to understand the caves of Migovec meant that surface work in Areas K, S and N (north of Kuk) was also a major consideration during the expedition.
 
A large and strong UK team, and a longer-than-usual expedition (five weeks instead of four) meant that we had sufficient manpower and time to achieve all expedition aims.
 
As in previous expeditions (’03, ’10, ’11), an underground camp (Camp *X-Ray*) was set up at -550 m in *Vrtnarija* to facilitate further exploration of the deep leads. 
Eighteen people from the UK and six Slovenes from the local JSPDT club spent nights at *X-Ray* for a total of 90 people-nights. 
This included three first-year cavers, all of whom contributed significantly to exploration. 
All but one pushing trips were done on overnight camps, with almost all successful exploration occurring below 500 m.
 
Three separate trips were made to *Kavkna Jama* in an attempt to forge the connection between SysMig and *Vrtnarija*. 
Though an acoustic connection was made when parties sent down Captain Kangaroo in *Vrtnarija* could hear the sound of drilling and hammering occurring in *Kavkna Jama*, the actual physical connection was elusive. 
Somewhat unexpectedly, the connection was instead made in a completely separate area of the cave when *Dreams for the Soul*, a phreatic passage off *Queen's Bedchamber* in *Vrtnarija*, dropped into *Waterloo* in SysMig (all at \textasciitilde -600 m).
 
Aided by perfect weather for much of the expedition, surface work was carried out by cavers in between underground camps. 
Most of it was concentrated in Areas K and N. 
Two pitches were dropped in N9 (a.k.a. 
Kuk Pot), with the continuation visible but hampered by a lack of time. 
Entrances K2, K… were also re-visited. 
K2 remains the most promising, while digging went on in K19.
 
In all we discovered 2703 m of new cave passage taking *Vrtnarija* to 13728 m long and 900 m deep. 
Thanks to the connection, the combined System Migovec is now 25592 m long and 973 m deep, with the deepest point being *Watership Down* in *Vrtnarija*, found during this year’s expedition. 
This makes SysMig the longest cave system in Slovenia, displacing the famous Postojna Jama as the previous record holder at 20190 m. 

## Cave Discoveries

Our major cave finds this year are described as these separate developments within Tolminski Migovec:


### Winter Action

In October 2011, a joint effort by ICCC and JSPDT was made to forge the connection. 
While the connection was ultimately unsuccessful, important survey work of recent years’ efforts in *Kavkna Jama* clearly showed which part of Kavkna was closest to *Vrtnarija*. 
As a result, the focus of exploration shifted from the bottom of Kavkna to *Wizard of Oz*, a bolt climb at -350 m that was pushed in 2009.
 
In the months between the October weekend and the start of the Sledi Vetra expedition, the JSPDT had multiple pushing trips at *Wizard of Oz*. 
The silted rift was dug through and widened to gain a fairly large, clean chamber with no obvious way on. 
A small passage about 3 m from the floor was expanded into yet more narrow and muddy crawls, eventually ending in a smaller chamber. 
Once again, easy progress was hampered by an extremely tight crawl. 


### *Vrtnarija* / *M2* (*Kavkna Jama*)

Three ‘connection’ trips were carried out during the expedition. 
On the first two attempts,  simultaneous trips were run to Capt Kangaroo in *Vrtnarija* and *Wizard of Oz* in Kavkna. 
Unfortunately, progress past the tight crawl in *Wizard of Oz* proved elusive as expanding it was slow work. 
However, on both occasions teams in *Vrtnarija* were able to hear the sounds of the Kavkna team drilling and hammering.
 
On the final attempt, the 8 m crawl in *Wizard of Oz* was passed. 
The passage enlarges into an immature rift but closes down almost immediately with silt and mud flakes, without any sort of draught. 
About midway through the crawl there seemed to be a very slight draught coming from a small hole in the floor, though any pushing here would require considerable effort spent digging. 
 

### *Watership Down*

*Watership Down* is the continuation of *Winter Journey*, a system of abandoned bedding planes at -888 m in *Vrtnarija*. 
Two pushing trips were carried out to explore rabbit warren-like system of crawls and chambers. 
From the *Winter Journey* pushing front, a series of steeply inclined bedding planes covered with a thick inch layer of mud were passed to gain a beautiful, clear static sump. 
Opposite the sump a passage leads off into a tight rift which was not pushed to its end; it is most likely a dead inlet. 
 

More interestingly, obvious traverses and windows above the sump were gained to find another crawl which ended above yet another static sump.
 
There are still undropped pitches and windows to be looked at in *Watership Down*, though it is unlikely more depth will be added.
 
A total of 140.96 m of passage was found in *Watership Down*, adding 12 m of depth to *Vrtnarija*. 
 

### Below '*Stuck in Paradise*'

At the end of the 2011 expedition, *Stuck in Paradise* (P69, -680 m) was dropped and two branches of extensive horizontal passage, *Salvation* and *Lost Miles*, were found below it. 
The possibility of more horizontal development at depth made the pushing of *Salvation* and *Lost Miles* a high priority.
*Salvation*
The squeeze left at the end of *Salvation* was hammered and dug through to gain a small chamber with a roaring draught (*Brave New World*). 
The way on down was blocked by a big boulder choke; instead, a carefully dug hole was followed upwards into sloping, crawling passage that enlarges to walking height. 
Eventually, the passage breaks into an active streamway, with the downstream passage taking the draught.
 
The downstream passage leads to an obvious phreatic continuation, which was blocked by a collapsed ceiling. 
This boulder choke was eventually squeezed through after two trips to reach 70 m of fine sandy passage (*Invictus*). 
This ends in a wet pitch (\textasciitilde P20) that was left unpushed.
 
172.4 m of mostly horizontal passage was found in the *Salvation* extensions. 
 

### *Lost Miles*

At the end of the 2011 expedition, *Lost Miles* was left as a draughting boulder choke. 
This year, we managed to chisel and hammer our way through, immediately breaking out into a large chamber and storming passage (*Atlantis*). 
After about 100 m a junction was reached with three ways on: continuation of the passage ahead, a turning to the right, and a pitch through a hole in the floor.
 
The pitch was dropped, but leads almost immediately to a boulder choke that looks promising but needs work (Inglourious Basterd).
 
The passage the right leads to about 250 m of easy caving (Minestrone), with occasional bouts of stooping and crawling. 
It eventually ends in a small chamber, with the way on being a low crawl blocked by rubble, though there is a draught. 
However, a subsequent digging trip to get past the blockage was unsuccessful, and any further progress would require considerable effort.
 
The continuation of *Atlantis* led to more walking passage. 
Most exciting was the discovery of a gallery of speleothems, including a vast array of helictites, stalactites, stalagmites and columns. 
This is probably the most decorated bit of cave we have found on Migovec thus far - certainly the highest concentration of stal.
 
*Atlantis* eventually becomes blocked with boulders in a low-roofed passage. 
Straight on there is a tight squeeze through which the continuation of the passage is visible. 
This was unpushed. 
Instead, a squeeze under boulders on the right was passed to reach a small, dry muddy tube that popped into a small chamber. 
The way on is a 10 m flat-out crawl, accompanied by the sound of water. 
The crawl emerges in a chamber at the bottom of a pitch, with a large waterfall entering from above. 
This was thus named *Brezno Slapov* (literally ‘waterfall pitch’).
 
A series of short cascades followed; exploration was eventually halted by the need for rope.
 
A total of 757.15 m of passage was found beyond *Lost Miles*.
 
Interestingly, these waterfall pitches found at the end of *Brezno Slapov* and *Invictus* are the first signs of water and active passage since Zimmer. 


### *Apollo* & the *Milky Way*

In 2011, an attempt at a bolt climb to gain a window in the *Queen's Bedchamber* was derailed by bands of thick, slippery mud preventing the successful installation of bolt belays. 
This year, armed with tent pegs to hammer into the mud as temporary belays, three pushing trips were required to conquer the bolt climb (*Apollo*, P35).
 
At the top of the climb a muddy, downward-sloping passage leads to a short pitch which lands in a large chamber. 
The passage on the right leads to a dead end; the way on is through a short bedding crawl on the left.
 
The crawl quickly widens into a small chamber with two ways on. 
Straight ahead is easy but muddy caving, eventually leading to a pitch which we suspect drops back into the *Queen's Bedchamber*. 
On the right is a long horizontal passage, mostly requiring easy crawling or stooping (*Milky Way*). 
At the end of this passage is a clean-washed chamber that joins a split-pitch midway. 
A high, wet aven drops into the chamber; the water then disappears under boulders. 
A way through the boulder floor is obvious and easy, leading to a pitch. 
On a subsequent trip this pitch was dropped but not surveyed. 
 
 
Midway through *Milky Way* is a turning off to the left, heading south-west. 
This was pushed for about 70 m to a boulder choke that was easily passed. 
Following the draught for about 50 m, a 20 m high rift was eventually reached; this rift is most likely the continuation of the *Minotaur*/*Guillotine* rift in *Vrtnarija*.
 
From the rift, a horizontal, crystal-covered phreatic passage continues South-West, heading directly towards System Migovec. 
The phreatic seems to have multiple levels, as it was sometimes possible to see empty space between the boulders below.
 
A couple of climbs later, a \textasciitilde 30 m wet pitch was reached. 
A bigger dark space could be seen across the pitch, so a traverse line was rigged. 
After 3 m of traversing, a bolt placed by cavers in 1998 was found. 
Across the traverse lay a large chamber (\textasciitilde 20 m wide) in the middle of which a PSS was found: *Waterloo* 13, 6/8/98/, JE/IMcK. 
On the last pushing day of the expedition, the connection to System Migovec was finally made! The passage was named *Dreams for the Soul*.
 
703.46 m of cave was found in the *Apollo* extensions. 


### The *Throne Room*

At the end of 2011 expedition there were two unpushed leads in the *Throne Room*: a pitch, and a window across it. 
The pitch (*Why the face?*) was dropped. 
The crawl below it leads immediately to a draughting pitch, which was also dropped but the passage below it quickly choked.
 
The traverse was bolted across to the window and up a steeply inclined, very loose boulder slope (*Hot Pants*). 
From the top of the traverse is a short climb up the slope and through a boulder choke to a fairly impressive chamber about 7 m high. 
A sandy tube goes from the edge of the chamber, blowing out; it is fairly committing and was left unpushed this expedition.
 
Two further trips were made to bolt climb up to the window in the chamber and push the passage beyond. 
This climb reached a ledge in the chamber, which gained parallel passage trending downwards at 30 degrees and pushed for 70 m (*Peep Show*).
 
Returning to the ledge, the upwards continuation (*Undercover Squirrel*) was pushed for 70 m up a couple of free climbs. 
Exploration was halted as a modest bolt climb was required to progress.
 
The area in general is of interest due to its location in the far North-East of the known cave passage - it is possible that it may access more 'deep level' galleries such as were discovered 300 m to the West within the mountain in 2003 and 2004.
 
281.61 m of passage was found in the leads off The *Throne Room*.


### *Xanadu*

*Xanadu* is a new and exciting lead found in 2012. 
It starts from a nondescript hole in the floor in *Friendship Gallery*, a mere 5 minutes from Camp *X-Ray* en route to *Big Rock Candy Mountain*. 
Surprisingly, no one explored it in the 9 years since we first camped at *X-Ray*!
 
The climb down through the hole immediately leads to an interesting rift with different levels. 
At the bottom (\textasciitilde 30 m below *Friendship Gallery*) is an active stream. 
Upstream was pushed to a wet squeeze, downstream ended in a sump.
 
However, the most promising way on is midway down the rift, where it is possible to gain a muddy, wet tube. 
Through this tube the character of the cave changes completely, with dry, muddy passage (Euphrates) instead of the clean-washed white rock of before. 
At the end of the muddy passage is a strongly draughting pitch.
 
Initial attempts to descend the pitch proved unsuccessful due to the poor quality of rock. 
The pitch remains undescended and is an exciting lead for 2013. 
 

86.69 m was found in *Xanadu*.

### *Yorkshire*

*Yorkshire* is the continued exploration along a narrow rift above an active waterfall at the bottom of the *Lower Pleasures* series, which was explored in 2011.
 
Initial narrow rift gives way to a squeeze above 2 m hole, which is followed by another squeeze into a small chamber. 
Turning left from the chamber quickly led to tight constriction from which an active stream enters and exits to the right. 
Turning right led to more narrow rift, which drops into a small pool of water after 8 m. 
A stream, which enters the pool from the left, was followed downstream for another 30 m before a dried mud junction was discovered at higher level.
 
The streamway continued further, but this was not surveyed.
 
The 2012 exploration of *Yorkshire* found 91.18 m of passage, most of which gently sloped northward, in parallel to *Highway 32*, 35 m below. 


### *Minotaur Rift*

The squeeze left at the far end of *Minotaur* Rift in the 2010 expedition was pushed to difficult crawling passage, often awkward with loose, sharp rocks. 
The rift continues along the same fault line as in *Minotaur* rift. 
A series of boulder chokes make progress interesting, including one which involves squeezing past a sharp rock, precariously wedged above one’s head (*Guillotine*).

\end{verse}
\attrib{Gergely}

After *Guillotine* is a very tight and sharp flat out crawl, sloping slightly downwards. 
The passage eventually pops out into the larger chamber. 
On inspection it proved to be a very big open fault (Razor). 
Looking up, a higher level can be observed. 
The way on continues down a small pitch and a further two climbs down. 
Unfortunately, the rift at the end gets too narrow to follow.
 
174.41 m was added to *Minotaur* rift.

### *Stagger Lee*

In 2011, a window off the side of *Big Rock Candy Mountain* was spotted. 
*Stagger Lee* is the continuation of this window located 17 m above the floor of *Big Rock Candy Mountain*. 
A high traverse was set up from the second last hanger. 
It was followed by a 15 m abseil and another 5 m traverse through falling water to gain the window.
 
Following the right hand side of the wall led to a series of cascading drops (P35 m) that ended on the floor of the twin shaft. 
Here, two streams combined into one active streamway beneath boulder-filled chamber.
 
The streamway continued for a further 14 m before dropping 10 m into a horizontal streamway which was later discovered to be the mouth of *Soda Stream*, killing interest in future exploration in this chamber. 
Nonetheless a side window heading in the general direction of  Balamory was spotted 4 m from the bottom. 
 
 
A total of 145.01 m of passage was found in *Stagger Lee*, part of which was a resurvey of *Soda Stream*. 


## Surface Work

Aided by perfect weather for much of the expedition, surface work was carried out by cavers in between underground camps. 
Most of it was concentrated in Areas K and N. 
Two pitches were dropped in N9 (Kuk Pot), with the continuation visible but hampered by a lack of time.
 
Entrances K2, K6, K11, K22, K21, K23, K24, K25, and K26 were also revisited. 
K22, K24, K25 did not seem at all promising. 
Good progress was made digging K6. 
Of the remainder, K2 seems to have the most potential, though all need a lot of work before the cave ¡goes¢. 


## Contributed stories

## 2012 – *Watership Down* & *Hot Pants*

The camp was set up and exploration was in full swing. 
The way out East already had its cohort of converts. 
For me there was one pushing front which had primacy above all others – namely the deepest point in the cave. 
*Winter Journey*, which I had explored with Jim and Fratnik last year, had a few niggling leads but nothing stellar. 
The silt deposits and depth indicated that a sump was not far away, but the inclined bedding heading North could continue for a very long time. 
With an interest in diving the sumps, I also had a distinct interest in the flooded sections.

Luckily Clare was easily suggested with the very bottom as a target. 
One concern was that the wet pitch series through Day Dreamers had been left rigged last year – we had anticipated further trips after our last one, but weather put paid to this. 
So we took a tackle sac of string to patch the pitches where necessary.

The one negative point was my little Canon 'pocket camera', hauled with nary a care in a Pelicase through all kinds of horrific caving locations over the previous six years had finally given up the ghost – and so we had no way to photographically record where we were visiting.

A smooth trip down to *Red Cow* was had, just enough of the route memorised from last year to make it smooth. 
We discussed the camping potential at *Red Cow* (very pleasant, I think) and despaired at the (lack of) quality in the rigging on the many little climbs and occasional pitches from the bottom of Big Rock. 
“On behalf of the entire 2003 & 2004 expedition I apologise” spoke Tetley on a previous trip with Clare.

I was interested in checking out the 'downstream' sump at *Red Cow*, which takes the majority of the water from the *Republika* chamber. 
So we followed a few cascades and reached a 3 metre drop with a single bolt. 
I believe the survey starts around here, but it's difficult to say as this region is poorly PSS. 
We attached one of our ropes, I abseiled down managing to walk back in the chamber to avoid the waterfall. 
The lake at the bottom of this chamber was not in fact the sump, rather a metre wide phreatic tube led off for perhaps ten metres, finally reaching a bend where the roof continued dipping but the water stayed still and level, with pools of brown silt sitting in the otherwise pure white floor.

Derigged, we climbed up in the rift at the previous cascade, and found an obvious dry level. 
This was strange, as I knew this passage was not on the survey, but there were clear marks from cavers passing. 
Clare and I decided to give it a proper push. 
Soon we found ourselves discarding bits of SRT kit and harness. 
We made a good team, Clare wriggling off through the smallest of gaps while I continued to expand them to human size behind. 
A flat out squeeze over cobbles took a while to reengineer, and a ninety degree bend to stand up in a wriggle rift took a lot of hammering by Clare to make it passable. 
Alas, she found herself in a region, again, with obvious caver marks the far side of the tight stuff, and soon “I've been here before” as she found a *Republika* PSS. 
We had connected between the downstream *Red Cow* sump and the head of *Insomnia* pitch (climb back out across the pitch along the large ledges, before turning right into a chamber leading off), connecting the 'crescent' shown previously on the survey. 
This only further complicates our understanding of the hydrology here – was this the old route for the *Red Cow* water, did it join up at *Insomnia* to form that impressive pitch, before it found a way out through the present cascades and sump? Still, we had fifty-five metres of survey in the book, a good thirty of which were new, where many cavers must have stood but none decided to push. 
This also offers a tight, though not horrifically so, flood safe bypass for *Republika*. 
With further enlargement it could even become the through way.

So, after a couple of hours diversion, we continued to our main target – the bottom. 
*Insomnia*'s rope was badly hung up, I had to reverse prussic about 20 m directly through the water before I'd stretched enough slack to rig my descender and very very gently (checking the rope) descended & unhooked the rope from the crack it had been wedged in.

The wet ropes in *Insomnia* were found to be in good nick, and so we abandoned the rigging gear to speed our progress. 
Interestingly, the only place where the rope had been abraded was the natural tied off bit to help you avoid landing in the big pool. 
Here the rope had been dangling a natural 'L' shape, and being gently swung back and forwards by the draught had sliced through the sheath and most of the core where it touched the rock ridges on the floor.

Back at *Winter Journey*, we threw ourselves into the rift and soon reached the exploration end. 
I essentially pushed Clare into the rift taking the draught, and she started enlarging with the bolting hammer and squeezing away. 
Progress was pretty quick, but I was captivated by the inclined bedding plane leading off. 
By myself, I hadn't dared climb down this last year. 
It didn't look so bad now, and Clare would definitely be able to follow me into this 'lobster pot' if that's what it turned out to be.

So I slithered down and away, a pretty long way down over dried silt, and reached a crawl way at the bottom. 
There was a gentle draught once more. 
I called Clare down, though she had nearly made it through her upward squeeze. 
We padded off through the rabbit warren like passage, dull thuds of our paws on the soft floor. 
“*Watership Down*” was the obvious name for this find – especially as I knew Clare liked the book. 
A branch to the right led upwards to a pitch into a chamber. 
Continuing ahead entered a slightly more confined space and a crawlway climbing back up the bedding to reach a T-junction. 
Here a large draught blew across, coming from a crawl / stoop leading down from the right. 
The way to the left soon turned into an inclined rift climb, steeper than other bits of bedding had seemed. 
But it was negotiatiable with care. 
The next climb looked rather more committing, the walls clearly belling out into a proper chamber, and what was that dark space down there?

I must admit exploration fever had rather got me at this point, as I climbed down without too much concern for the return journey. 
I was stunned by what I climbed down towards – a large, crystal clear, sump with a clear rock arch leading off into turquoise blue depths. 
The slight seriousness of our situation was rather underlined by Clare arriving, with a clatter and a woosh as she lost her footing and nearly, in that caving cliché, fell into the terminal sump.

We ignored the inclined cliff that was our only escape, and continued exploration. 
The main sump was beautiful, but a parallel route through the rocks led to a smaller, obviously connected, body of water. 
From below, a clear balcony was visible above the sump, and with a rope, would be a passable pendulum. 
Feeding into the sump was a dry inlet, which led away through a small crawlway. 
This we pushed until it started to get rather catchy and surveyed out, though further progress is certainly possible. 
Our survey down here complete, including a plastic PSS at sump level on the sandy beach, we had to tackle the climb. 
Clare went up first, after a few false starts and slithering back down, we found a working method utilising 'combined tactics', where I would bridge across the floor and ceiling and be stood on. 
Her safely up, I slipped back down again and was lowered the end of the survey tape to complete the measurements – 9.83 m to safety.

There was nothing Clare could do to help as I slipped and struggled. 
The mud on the walls had been made slimy, the footholds were degenerating. 
I slowly slithered up the far end of the rift where it was narrow and I could bridge most effectively, but therefore had to deal with overhanging sections which I scaled, somehow, with the minimum of poise and grace. 
As we surveyed out Clare had to indicate the stations again and again, the buzzing in my head was dissolving memories as fast as they were forming.

Time was pressing on and we did not have time to look at the many leads left in the  rabbit warrens. 
Instead we made a speedy exit, Clare taking the exploration bits and bobs, I choosing to pull up the ropes as there is never a guarantee of return at these extreme ends of the cave system.

*Red Cow* offered it's usual calming influence; the strange 'quiet corridor in an alien spaceship' feel to these horizontal sections was comforting where it had been disquieting. 
We sat there munching the food we had stashed on the way in, rehydrating even as our Meander oversuits steamed off their splashes from *Insomnia* and *Republika*. 
I thought dark thoughts about the riggers of both these pitches, in their different 'exploration rigging' ways my two most hated and, in my consideration, dangerous pitches of the cave. 
And there they were together, back to back, a gauntlet to be passed on the way to the depths, and a horrible back-of-mind barrier to the exit to safety.

The way back to camp passed smoothly. 
Back for tea and medals, talk of daring do and plans for a rather more sedate second day.

### The Day After

Our plan for the second day was rather more constructivist in intent. 
Since exploring the *Throne Room* last year, no one had returned except to the large obvious windows which had formed '*Amazing Grace*' and the way to the East. 
Clare and I knew there to be a potential traverse, and also a short pitch. 
This area is relatively close to Camp *X-Ray* and so would be a good place for less experienced teams to cut their teeth. 
So we packed up the Uneo drill and made our way along Kamikaze and the Red Baron traverse. 
The leads are as we remember them, and I quickly rig up the start of the traverse and place a bolt in the large boulder for abseil (with tackle sac rope protector) into the pit. 
Confirming it's a going lead with a pitch leading off, I come back up and get stuck into the main metal of the traverse.

[Nb: If it doesn't get written up elsewhere, Nico et al. 
Dropped this pitch, and a few more climbs and cascades before it degenerated – from the survey and form of the cave, it looks as if you're descending the immature vadose formation below the *Throne Room* boulder collapse.]

The first few bolts are just fine – swing and bolt, rejiggle the rigging and move outwards one metre. 
From my perch around the corner, I realise that this is rather more demanding than had been hoped – not a traverse over the pit and into a side passage, but a continuing climb traverse out of the end of the chamber. 
I keep at it, finding passable rock to bolt in the overhung ceiling, and somehow climbing backwards over stopped boulders and chunks of dried mud. 
I am not, as it were, enjoying myself at this point. 
The bolts aren't being tested as I pass, and I'm climbing a good few metres in height between placements, on semi static rope and without a belayer, just judging the length of slack. 
Considerable quantities of footholds disappear bouncing down the slope, flying into the pit at the bottom. 
I explain this predicament to Clare. 
She replies with “Well, you don't have any choice – we don't have the dynamic rope with us and we're not going back to camp.” Charmed.

Clare, shivering on a boulder while I sweated with outstretched drill, also has an idea for the survey name – *Hot Pants*. 
Why? “I have a plan, and it's as hot as my pants...” - Lord Flashart

At the top I reach a little chamber with an obvious climb leading up through a boulder choke. 
The traverse rope is just long enough to belay as far as the top of the climb, but not to protect the way across. 
Feeling rather flushed and vertigous at the achievement (19.44 m at 50 degrees says the survey, between here and the last traverse bolt) I finalise the rigging. 
Clare follows me on the rigged line, I watch it scratch at a particularly large pile of boulders which I didn't dare disturb – derigging from the bottom and gardening back from the top would make a lot of sense long term.

We climbed up carefully through the boulder choke and were rewarded with a beautiful little chamber, about 12 x 4 m, with a high ceiling and an obvious balcony a good four metres off the floor. 
Out of gear, we looked at the crawlway heading NNW out of the chamber. 
This was taking a distinct draught, and was easy (though rather small) going with a white silt floor. 
Clare slithered over a little dam and wriggled off, coming back to state it was going but rather small. 
I couldn't be bothered with such arduous squeezing at this stage, and expecting that this lead would be looked at first before bolt climbing plans, was happy to survey out.

Strangely, this crawl wasn't again looked at – instead the teams who came after us hand bolt climbed to the balcony and beyond, gaining passage 7 metres above the chamber floor, which led to 73 m of gently descending passage to the NNE (Peepshow), terminating at a boulder choke,  and then 78 m of gently ascending passage due North into blank mountain (*Undercover Squirrel*) terminating at a 4 m draughting climb into a chamber.

And that was the story of my first camping trip with Clare. 
I certainly felt rather pleased – we had gone after the lesser leads and multiplied them through our efforts. 
Finding the beautiful *Watership Down* sump was a joy, but the *Hot Pants* traverse climb was perhaps the most important work in terms of the exploration it enabled.

## The Piss Bandits and the *Undercover Squirrel* 

The prospect of spending a second summer camped on Migovec carried with it an entirely different mix of emotions than those preceding my first year. 
Gone were the fears of the unknown, replaced with an exciting familiarity that may be felt when meeting an old friend. 
Perhaps more importantly though, was a new sense of independence and confidence that had been lacking throughout my first year. 
No longer was there a reliance on someone to show me the ropes and, as such, I found myself fitting into the carries and rigging that typify the beginning of the expedition, feeling like an experienced member of the team. 
Bivi life was great. 

My sleeping arrangements were shared with Nico, an arrangement that benefitted the rest of the expedition, as our messiness and stench was confined to a smaller area of the mountain. 
Our general hygiene levels and lack of experience lead to us christening our team as the ‘piss bandits.’ 
As we seemed to get on well, his laid-back style balancing my seriousness and as we were both looking for that ‘next level of expedition independence’ we decided to form a two man team to head down to camp and have a taste of pushing. 

The focus of our first pushing trip was to be an area past the *Red Baron* chamber named Queen's Road. 
We had been told of a short pitch with a possible continuation at the bottom. 
Simple, immediate access to virgin cave; perfect. 

Needless to say, our lack of experience made the whole process take much longer than we had initially thought. A dodgy bolt was placed by Nico before we swapped rigging duties and I placed a suspect deviation that allowed access to the bottom of the pitch. Immediate gratification was not found as the next section, despite being a small drop, required a bolt to be placed in an awkward, narrow position. Cursing ensued as Nico placed the bolt and wriggled his way down. Thankfully, the space seemed to open and a further 5 m pitch promised open walking passage at the bottom. 

Now feeling much more relaxed bolting, I hurried down the next pitch to find a large boulder filled chamber. 
We shouted to each other with excitement and continued down the chamber to find a disappointing boulder choke that barred the way on. 
Being the ‘piss bandits,’ we marked our territory before deciding it was time to head out, surveying along the way. 
On our way out, we checked another continuation further along the *Queen's Road* passage (up **Hot Pants**) that seemed very promising if bolt climbed and made a note to tell the others. 

The next few days camping were awful as the wind picked up on Migovec and I found myself unable to sleep without being hit repeatedly by the side of our collapsing tent. 
Needless to say, we headed back down having had little sleep, eager to escape the miserable weather. 
During our absence underground, Oli and Thara had attempted to complete the bolt climb and had unfortunately run out of time before completing it. 

Myself and Nico hurried up *hot pants* to the climb and I set up off the rope. 
Placing a couple of bolts to traverse left to a ledge I was faced with a steep step followed by a muddy slope to the top of the pitch. 
Having tried to a place a bolt in the friable, muddy rock I gave up and clambered up the step and the slope, feeling confident that the climbing skills I had acquired in London bouldering gyms were enough to ensure safety. 
In hindsight they probably weren’t as I awkwardly fell up the slope like a new born calf just on the edge of physical control. 
Standing at the top, adrenalised, the passage opened out into a large walking passage similar. 
There were two extensions, one upslope and one downslope and both seemed extremely promising. 
As I placed a bolt, myself and Nico yelped to each other, discussing what we may find. 
This was it, this was our first taste of promising lead! 

First we headed downslope into a large boulder filled chamber that Oli and Thara had asked us to christen ‘*Peep Show*.’
It was as the piss bandits had hoped, easy pushing for a few hundred metres before the passage ended in a boulder choke, just like our previous ‘lead’. 
Nevertheless, the boulders here were much larger and the chamber floor was built like a rabbit warren. 
The wind drafted in a small hole at the limit of the chamber that Nico attempted to squeeze into. 
The continuation narrowed within a few metres to the point where Nico could not continue and, with a lot of writhing and whimpering, he navigated his way back out. 
Being of the larger build, I didn’t stand a chance. 
Needless to say, we were gutted, however, this time we had a plan B. 

The upslope continuation, that was later named *Undercover Squirrel*, was much more fun. 
The passage was similar to that of hot pats and, whilst mostly walking passage, there were a few muddy slopes and a couple of climbs that made the passage much more sporting. 
One, in particular, required us to wedge our body against the wall and slide down a muddy slope, just in control until a rocky step was reached that could then be clambered down. 
On the way back, such climbs proved more worrying. 
We continued upwards until we reached a chimney that could be climbed up into a large muyd bedding plane with another climb up to a small window. 
Unfortunately, another bolt climb was required and we surveyed our way back out, pleased with our efforts. 
Whilst there was the absence of a large, billowing draft, the lead nonetheless continued into blank mountain.

Back at underground camp, a rather cold and miserable Tetley and Rhys arrived bringing tales of poor weather up top. 
Whereas during my first year underground camp had been a cold, remote area that had been psychologically troubling to spend a great deal of time in, it had since transformed into a place of considerable comfort and warmth; a second home. 
As such, it was with displeasure that we pried ourselves away from the soupy, cheesy, fishy, noodley smash and headed out from camp *X-ray* to the surface. 

Emerging at the top of Migovec, we found the mountain deserted. 
As the weather had worsened, the rest of the expedition had fled the mountain for a mid-Expo break. 
The site wasn’t exactly welcoming and, with the sun beginning to set, we made the decision to jog down to Tolmin. 
We hurried down in the night, lighting the paths with our head torches, fuelled on by prospect of a cold beer in warm, civilised abodes. 
We passed the other cavers as they sat at a restaurant near the Devil’s Bridge (Nico, “Heeeyyy maaannn, is that the ootthhheers?”), yet, thinking that we were hallucinating we rushed passed down to Tolmin. 
As such, we arrived at Tetely’s house, locked out. 
We collapsed in two content heaps and waited for others, considering the improbability that 6 hours previously, we had been 600 metres underground.

## Diving Dreams

A few more carries and a visit to the fleshpots and Wifi of Tolmin, and I needed to decide what to do next. 
My big hope was diving, I had stuffed a barrel full of my cave diving gear and hidden my fully pumped 7 Litre cylinders in the back of the van. 
Now with such a clear and accessible (though very remote) sump, diving was a genuine possibility. 
At first I decided the logistics were simply impossible, but there seemed to be a lot of people making positive noises about portering assistance, and so, deciding to commit, readied my gear at Ravne.

Some of the Slovenians had promised help in portering the gear to Kal, unfortunately the motorbike broke terminally while carrying the cylinders. 
Abandoned in the forest, they were carried the last zig zags by hand. 
My lead weights arrived in the Bivi almost as if by magic.

But every move closer to the pushing front had fewer and fewer volunteers. 
Offers of assistance are gladly made in the sunny cafes of Tolmin. 
Fundamentally when the choice is porterage of diving gear at the expense of dry exploration, the choice of expedition members was clear.

Ideally the diving also required the setting up of a camp at *Red Cow*. 
I had prepared a lightweight two-man camp for this application, and had assumed that people would at least be interested in visiting the bottom of the cave or extending the leads further North in the deep levels. 
However, one can't really direct exploration in this way, and the majority of the expedition efforts went into the extensive horizontal levels found below *Stuck in Paradise* – only two trips went beyond Big Rock this summer, and I was on both of them.

I solo'd my way to *X-Ray* with a 7 Litre bottle and fin in a tacklesac, and a weight belt of 8 kg of lead. 
This was actually found to be not too difficult, though frightening on the little down climbs!

Approaching the end of my three weeks on the mountain, I finally had to accept that the sumps were out of my reach. 
I was exhausted through my efforts, making myself sick through not enough rest.

My last mad plan involving hijacking the ever eager Oli and spending essentially three days portering gear to the dive site, diving, and abandoning cylinders for the winter, was replaced by a rather more sane plan to explore the bottom, and, sadly, drag my cylinder out from camp.

I pulled my shoulder really quite badly during this trip, which made my slow exit from *X-Ray* hauling steel arduous and painful. 
The situation on the surface wasn't much more pleasant. 
The Bivi talk was full of suspicion that I would abandon without carrying all the dive gear (and, indeed, my unused photographic gear) down. 
So there was nothing to do but swipe opiates from the first aid kits, ignore my grinding bones and do my carrying duty. 
I must admit it was with considerable sadness and little will to return that I finally struck my tent, squeezed the last few bits into my rucksack, ached down the mountain and boarded a bus out of Tolmin.

My 8 kg of diving Lead sits at *X-Ray* currently labelled with a simple note:- ´Jarv's Folly¡

Everything is clear in hindsight. 
I should never have started preparing to dive, instead put my efforts into dry exploration & bolt climbing of the deep levels and, potentially, readying the ground for a diving trip in future years. 
Still, we live and learn, and ´Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a Heaven for?¡

## Cutting your neck at the *Guillotine*

It is always a long time that passes between two expeditions. A time for living the normal life, doing the work, caving a lot, fixing or purchasing new gear, and -- making plans for the next year. 

As so much passage had been discovered within the -600 m phreatic level, it became reasonable to hope that there might be a connection between *Sistem Migovec* and *Gardener's World* at this depth. The efforts for finding the connection at -400 had been failing for years, despite the plenty of action and enormous energy that went into this action. Meanwhile, large amounts of passages had been found at -600 with much less effort, and sometimes they went as far as 500 m on a trip. Therefore, it was not insane to look for the connection here. 

But where could it be? Although *Vrtnarija* had now several kilometres of passages at this level, the System only intersected it. Back in the years the primary goal was to reach the -1000 m barrier, and it was evident looking at survey – there were almost no horizontal sections that had been found below 400 metres depth. There was only one place on the survey which resembled something like *Friendship Gallery*: the area around *Elephant* and *Waterloo*, not far from *Hotel Tolminka*. To make things even more complicated, these could not be reached without changing the ropes, and we did not have the manpower and the gear to do so. Therefore, if one wanted to find a connection, it had to be done from the *Vrtnarija* side. Given the dimensions of the cave, this was nothing less than finding a needle in the haystack.

Looking at the plan of the cave, we noticed that *Minotaur rift* was heading more or less towards *Elephant*, about the same depth level. The horizontal distance between these two points was about 250 m, which was not so much considering the potential in the phreatic level. Moreover, the *Minotaur* rift was formed along a huge, very well defined fault line, which had a strong potential for continuation at both ends. (This fault could also be found at the -800 level). It is there that I wanted to look for the passage leading to the System!

After the great pushing day with Kate, Clare and Rhys and finding *Atlantis*, we decided to go there with Rhys. At the end of the *Minotaur* rift, just where the crystals appear and the passage turns towards the right, it was possible to continue along the fault line in a small passage. We only had to continue this line, and it was a straightforward task to do. This has already been pushed to a boulder choke by James Kirkpatrick. There was only one minor problem: the fault line itself! For obvious reasons, the rock there was extremely loose and broken. So, on one hand, we had to move a lot of rocks in order to make progress, but on the other hand, we were never quite sure whether the ceiling was going to collapse on us or not.

There was one point along the passage, where we needed to squeeze down on the left hand side. We managed to move quite a number of rocks, but one large one remained there, and there was nothing for it but to squeeze underneath. When I finally attempted to pass under this rock blade, of course it moved… but luckily, by not so much. Since there was no space for putting the rock anywhere else, we tried to stack smaller rocks underneath in order to keep it up. Still, when you climbed, your head was directly under it… good luck! So, the name of the passage became *Guillotine*!

Eventually, after long hours of battling against the rocks, we managed to emerge in an open space: the fault line opened up again! We found ourselves at the top of a \textasciitilde 30 m high rift, whith an active streamway, with beautiful white walls! In the squeeze, we found haematite pebbles and in some places along the fault line, the rock looks like marble, which would be very nice were it not for the fact that it constantly rains down on your head. Crawling out from *Guillotine* was even harder than going in, since the whole passage was sloping downwards. Moreover, as we crawled, the oversuits became packed with sharp little rocks, while other rocks constantly fell on our heads. A truly fascinating place! Still, the continuation was at the bottom of a large, open  and going rift – quite the lead…

Later, we returned with Jana to rig the rift at the end, and to survey the passage. The end of the rift needed some bolt climbing, but we could hear that it continued on with large volumes. Moreover, to our surprise, the passage went more than 100 metres in the direction of the System! Thus, the distance to the connection became less than 120 metres. We then planned to go back there to climb up the following year. Thanks God, the events that followed later made this heroic attempt unnecessary (since *Sanje za Duso* \sidenote{\emph{Dreams for the Soul}} crosses the continuation of the rift).  It is thus likely that nobody will ever enjoy the special treatment of *Guillotine* again. Who knows, maybe since then, the large boulder has already fallen down, sealing the passage for eternity…

## 2012 – Watership Up with Oli

Oli hadn't yet been on the serious pushing trip he was clearly capable of. 
Having abandoned diving plans, I went down with him on the standard two nighter. 
First stop, before bed, was the fabled Esoterica. 
This was quite an interesting place, being a streamway cutting through the Prince Consort Road horizontal level before the Albert Hall. 
The Serpentine stream at the Albert Hall almost certainly forms the development which goes all the way to *Watership Down*, there's every reason to believe this streamway may proceed similarly. 
However, tails of wet rift from the original explorers (James KP and Jan in 2010) have dissuaded a return. 
We found the climb down through the boulders, and arrived at the 10 m pitch (taking water from the little inlet in the left of Prince Consort Road) I'd previously stood at. 
We commenced bolting, taking turns.

While Oli was tapping away, I climbed over the rift pitch, down a 4 metre free climb and intersected a different stream. 
This stream came down (on the left) from an easily gained chamber, with vast quantity of beautiful haemetite on the shelves. 
The continuation (to the right & following the stream down) was obvious, and I can only assume that this is 'Esoterica' as pushed by James KP and Jan.

I related this to Oli back at the pitch head. 
We finished the backup bolt no problem, but horror of horrors, broke the driver placing the hang bolt. 
A few minutes experimenting with alternative natural rigging (all too dodge) and we accepted unhappy defeat. 
Should have brought a second driver. 
Should have brought the drill. 
I left a long and meandering note underlining the point that this pitch was not dropped, and the way to what I believe is Esoterica.

It's one of those strange quirks of expedition – we had what seemed to be two independent streamways, both going and barely an hour away from camp. 
Yet no one returned here either.

Having decided returning to camp for a replacement driver was too long a round trip, I took Oli on a tourist trip to Palace of *King Minos*. 
We admired both the formations, the unpleasant nature of '*Guillotine*' and the admirable efforts in bolt climbing the *Queen's Bedchamber*, and returned via the Oroborus alternative to the Albert Hall – odd passage formation indeed.

### Day 2

We set off for the deep. 
I find Big Rock a rather unfriendly place. 
Though no one had been here since my previous trip (in 2011), I found a lot of the bolts disturbingly loose. 
Always a worry with rawl bolts; I also had dark thoughts of some kind of bolt loosening cave monster, which I imagined as some kind of spanner assisted sloth.

The way to *Red Cow* was almost second nature now – the third time in two years. 
I pointed out the few bits I'd figured out about the route on the way, and dealt the stack of playing cards I had filled my Meander pocket with (arrows and '*Red Cow*' or 'Big Rock' to waymark the two opposite destinations). 
At *Red Cow*, we repacked and left a Daren drum and food stash, then continued on down to the bottom with a single bag of bolting kit, rope and survey gear. 
Oli made short work of the sideways wriggles in *Winter Journey*, and with sanity rather than wanderlust on our side we set about rigging the steep muddy climbs which Clare & I had slithered down and had such trouble climbing. 
While I merrily tapped in the first bolt, Oli had a quick look at the 'upwind' route from the T-junction and came back shortly having wandered to the bottom of a climb he didn't fancy by himself.

At the main climb, I realised I'd rigged the scrappy ropes we'd brought in the wrong length order – Oli sorted this out behind me while I placed a Y-hang off the opposite walls. 
The depth of the dry silt was impressive – I chiseled off 5cm deep plates from both walls to find the rock.

Arriving at the sump with rather more poise and grace than last time, we noted that the plastic PSS at the shore edge had floated off into the sump – clearly the level had increased (at least minutely) at some point during the previous two weeks. 
I also threw a few rocks in the sump to try and gauge how deep it was (4 m I estimate) and stomped in the shallows a bit to try and assess the visibility for diving potential (remarkably good, surprisingly no brown mud, the coarse sand settling very quickly). 
 Wearing my wet socks, I was trying to psyche myself up into traversing along the right hand (sloping rock ledge) of the sump to try and assess whether it continued around the corner, or stopped with a rock wall.

Oli reckoned he could have a chance at the balcony, and prussic'd up the rope before swinging across. 
He left the rope pulled over, but having got together our survey instruments I grew bored of waiting for him to return, and flicked the rope off to follow.

The level gained, Watership Up, was really quite interesting – very difficult to tell how it formed, other than the obvious bedding plane bit and with strange (large!) echoes leading off from tight rifts. 
Following the natural route past puddles of Hematite and along a protracted flat out squeeze we came to a section of rift with a drop down onto a lake. 
This was a definite lake, as we could see both ends of the body of water, but otherwise looked very similar to the main sump. 
The pitchhead down from the rift would be narrow but certainly doable. 
We surveyed our way back, notably there was a collection of those strange spider-web like filaments covered with droplets in a cranny of the rock. 
Always a bit spooky when you come across them – no matter how much one reminds oneself that they must be some kind of slime mold or fungus, the image of a massive cave spider is hard to shake!

With time already surprisingly tight, and a long way to climb, we set off out, pulling all the ropes up with a bittersweet melancholy. 
We had put the rigging effort in to further the next party, and effortlessly found passage, but there remained so many question marks, and no other parties intended to return down here this year.

Back at Redcow we toasted our mackerel with a splash of the meths recovered from 'daydreamers', and then had a warm Vitaminski (pusher's delight). 
We filled up our Daren drum with water – measuring the *Red Cow* stream as 1L/s (by filling a 6L Daren drum in a timed 10s, capturing about 60% of the stream). 
This Daren, along with the 'bivi liberated' mess tin and blue 2L Sigg bottle (with perhaps 200 ml of meths left) was left sitting in the sand of the main *red cow* passage. 
There was talk of bolt climbers making their way down this way to investigate 'Strap on the Nitro'. 
This didn't happen, and so those resources stand there currently, awaiting the 2013 developments.

The slog on home to *X-Ray* continued with little comment – other than I managed to pull a shoulder on the Memory Lane climbs. 
We also managed to flood the passage with smoke by leaving the fish tin to burn itself out (also burning the paint). 
Interestingly, and in contradiction to the original explorers memories, the cave draft  took this in the direction of Big Rock, we found ourselves caving through this fug till at least Memory Lane.

The way out from *X-Ray*, with diving cylinder in tow, was slow indeed. 
I sent Oli off ahead, and laboured my way behind. 
Some of the Urinal series pitch heads were really quite acrobatic when dragging a third leg through!

## *Sanje za Duso* (*Dreams for the Soul*)

The last pushing trip of the expo is always a bit extreme: we don’t have to reserve our energy anymore, so let’s go with full power! It was really great and exciting news that Mafi finished the climb of the **Apollo** in *Queen's Bedchamber*, and at the top, yet another phreatic passage was found, with some junctions that they did not have time for checking out. So it was an obvious plan to go there. In fact, at the top of the climb there were two possible continuations, and the other one (at your back when you climb up) seemed to be even bigger. So, my plan was to traverse across the top of the pitch to reach this possibly large gallery. I managed to persuade Karin to give it a go, and there we were, going down on the well-known route to *X-Ray*. Here we come, *Vrtnarija*!

Of course, we were dreaming of the connection, or rather joking about it. Karin said that she had a good name in her mind, which was also the name of a hard climbing route that had been completed recently. But when I asked her what it was, she replied that she can only say it if we find the connection. So there we were, with a (hopefully) good name for a passage that will only be given if it connects the two systems… 

After a good night sleep, and a healthy morning meal with meat and tomato, we packed up all the gear for climbing the traverse: drill, bolts, hangers, maillons, rope, and so on. Reaching the *Queen's Bedchamber* is a pleasant trip. There is one peculiarity though: at the low passage in the chamber with the plenty of crytals, again there was almost no wind. In the first year, when we found it, there had been a huge draught here. Probably it was connected with the excess of water in that time: almost all the big pitches had large waterfalls in them. Nevertheless, we were certain that something big awaits us at the top of the *Apollo* climb.

I made my way up carefully on the rope. It was absolutely terrible. The pitch was (and remains) the worst in the whole system; one can see the heroic effort to reach the top, climbing through mud, montmilch, loose rocks, and so on. Hopefully, a bypass will be rigged one day here… 

Anyway, both of us managed to get to the top without killing ourselves or the other, and we started the preparation for the climb. However, just after I drilled the first hole, on cable of the drill came out loose! There was nothing to do with it, so there we were, with all the equipment, but without a working drill… The climb was way too long to be done with hand bolting. So what should we do? Well, let’s check out that junction that Mafi was talking about (and for which, jokingly, I said that there is the connection :)  (The next year we did the climb with Peter. Guess what? There is nothing on the other side!)

The passage leading there was nice, and soon we found ourselves at the junction. Entering the passage, our good old friends showed up on the wall: the wind-crystals! Hmm, so there used to be quite a strong draught here… let’s see where it comes from!

We had to work on two squeezes for quite a while, especially that we did not have a chisel, just a bolting hammer. But the crystals were always there, showing us the right direction. (There was also a strange thin material, like spider web or hair, in some places. Maybe that is formed by bacteria, but it should be checked out…) Moreover, as we proceeded, we constantly checked the compass, and it seemed that we are heading directly towards the System! The distance that we had to cover was about 150 metres.

The passage was small, at one squeeze I had to take off my SRT to pass through. Finally, after negotiating yet another squeeze, we entered in a big space! It was a rift, about 25 m high, and checking the direction, we were certain that we managed to get to the continuation of the *Minotaur* rift-*Guillotine* fault line. So, the game was on! We climbed up in the rift towards *Guillotine* in order to have a look, but that was not the goal why we were here…

Just as in the fairy tales, a nice open passage started from basically the point where we emerged in the rift. Its direction was right towards the system! Our distance at this point was about 50 metres. There was a draught and crystals, so we became quite excited… We started to follow the passage. Then a climb up, then… it is blocked here! Hmm, a dead end. But going back to the passage, we noted that it actually has more levels, it was a phreatic meander. We could pass one level below, then again up, then again down, then… we ended up in a passage which lead to the side of a fairly big pitch with a waterfall!! By that time, I knew the description of *Waterloo* by heart, so I became very curious. There was a small ledge, about 30 cm wide, on the right hand side of the pitch, going across (maybe 5 m long). Luckily, we had some rope and maillons,  so I started off from a natural, and proceeded carefully along the ledge. Then, in the middle, where I had to step down, I saw… 2 rusty spits!! So, there it was, there we were: the result of so much effort by so many people, on the last pushing day of the expedition, following the wind crystals, we got into the system! 

I called out to Karin. “Hey Karin, what is the name that you had in your mind?” “What?” ”Well, you better remember the name, because there are two rusty spits here!” At the beginning, she did not want to believe it, but after I got to the other side and fixed the rope, she saw it herself. We stood for a minute, still not believing what happened. On the other side of the pitch, there is a nice big chamber (*Waterloo*), and soon we found the PSS 13 from Dave Wilson and  Andy Jurd, who have been here in 1998. We built a huge cairn, and placed a sign, stating the exact date and time, and the fact that System Migovec became the longest cave system in Slovenia! And the name? *Sanje za Duso*, which means *Dreams for the Soul*… really an aptly named passage!

Fate is a strange thing. If back in 1998, instead of descending down *Waterloo*, they had traversed the pitch and followed the passage that we came through, they could have found basically the whole horizontal development in *Vrtnarija*. On the other hand, we would probably not know *Concorde*, *Pico*, or *Happy Monday*. And also, we could not have found the connection, and could not have this story either. 

What happened after? We carefully surveyed everything of course. Descending down the *Apollo* climb was just as bad as climbing up. Back in *King Minos* palace, we admired the crystals one more time, now knowing for sure that indeed, there was something big behind them  – namely, a system of at least 12 km of caves! Back at home, in *X-Ray* (which was 70 metres lower now than in the morning), we decided to celebrate by a candlelit dinner, and by finishing off our whisky reserves. So we made one hot chocolate whisky after the other… As a result, the next morning I was in terrible shape, although Karin did not have any problem. Strong girl! We started to pack up, enjoyed the last solitary time before the transporting team arrives, and then the news started to spread – the connection has been found! Big celebration on the surface, media, party – but that is another story. Jonny’s final entry in the logbook for 2012: “So, an ordinary derig was made much less ordinary when Gergely + Karin told me that the cave is now 70 m deeper. Hooray for sys-mig.”

It was a moment that is going to stay with us for our whole life. But I particularly like it because it really has been the result of the effort of the whole group, over so many years. We had been lucky to have the chance of being there – but we had been even more lucky to belong to such an excellent team of nice friends.

## Prospect for 2013

Despite the success of the 2012 expedition, it is clear that there remains a large amount of cave to be discovered in *Vrtnarija* and Migovec. 
In *Vrtnarija*, the obvious areas to focus our attention on include: the descent of the wet pitches at the end of *Brezno Slapov* and *Invictus*, pushing the rift at the end of *Milky Way*, further exploration of *Xanadu* and *Lower Pleasures*, various unpushed leads in *Watership Down* at the bottom, and a second bolt climb to a window at *Queen's Bedchamber* that seems to be the continuation of the horizontal development found in Milk Way. 
Furthermore, as we now have the necessary know-how and equipment to bolt climb, there are various ¡deep¢ leads to revisit from the 2003 expedition such as Strap on the Nitro. 


In some ways, we have the fortunate problem of almost being too successful in recent years, as the leads are now fairly spread out and getting further from camp each year. 
This year, it was common for pushing trips to *Watership Down* and *Invictus*/*Atlantis* to take upwards of 21 hours. 
Nonetheless, Camp *X-Ray* remains the most likely camp due to its central location and easy access to water -- however, an additional lightweight 2 man camp nearer to the more remote locations is a strong possibility. 


Thanks to the connection there are also old leads in the old SysMig that are worth revisiting, especially around the *Waterloo* area. 


In October 2012, on the annual ICCC/JSPDT ¡winter action¢ weekend, a breakthrough was made in *Primadona*, another cave system on mountain. 
Due to its close proximity to the System, this will be the next big connection project in our bid to shed more light on the complex subterranean system under Migovec.
