# 2009 --- Brezzvezdna Noč: 

## Summary

The 2009 Brezzvezdna Noč expedition was extremely successful, with 4 weeks spent in the field camping by special permission in the Triglav national park on Tolminski Migovec. A slideshow presentation was given at the end of the expedition in the Tolmin library by Andrej Fratnik (JSPDT) and Jarvist Frost (ICCC), translated to Slovene by Jana Carga (JSPDT/ICCC). Our findings were also presented as a lecture at the BCRA 2009 conference by Jarvist Frost.

In the Vrtnarija system (5.70km/802m at beginning of expo) we installed a camp at –254m in an until now torturous parallel shaft series (Captain Kangaroo). This was the major factor that enabled us to add 225m of depth to the Dark Tranquillity series, connecting two wings of Vrtnarija and creating a stunning 562m deep alpine exchange trip. In addition we performed three major climbs in the area of the camp in an attempt to connect Vrtnarija to Sistem Migovec (11.52km, 970m deep), pushed Tolminska Korita (below the main pitch series in Vrtnarija at -550m) a further –45 m, and pushed upstream above the Red Cow sump at -750m to discover an aven fed watershed and an active pitch series. We now have five major leads all at a depth greater than 500m.

In the M2 part of Sistem Migovec, progress was slower but an aided climb was made to a phreatic series that terminates in a drafting boulder pile, and now forms the closest approach between the two systems.

In all, we discovered 854 m of new passage in Vrtnarija (bringing the total polygon length to 6.58km) and 101 m in smaller caves and digs on the surface, bringing the total for Migovec to 22.9 km.
An updated survey of Vrtnarija (in extended elevation) has been prepared, including transformation of all mountain survey data into grid north.

## Expedition Proceedings

During the 2008 expedition a consider effort was spent exploring the Captain Kangaroo branch of Vrtnarija, with the sole aim of connection to the passage in Sistem Migovec. Our rate of exploration was limited by the length of time taken to get to the pushing front, with fifteen hour trips being the minimum to achieve much. The obvious solution for 2009 was to setup a camp.

Thirty-two people-nights were spent at the two man underground camp, with two twelve hour shifts of hot-bedding. Exploration in this section (Captain Kangaroo, Vrtnarija) was split between looking at climbing leads in the hope of connecting to M2, and pushing the Dark Tranquillity series downwards. The majority of the climbing was done via bounce trips from the surface, and also as 'light days' for people on their way out from camp. All the deep pushing was done from the camp downwards. Total amount of caving was 98 people trips, including camping trips.

In 2008 we had left the developing pitch series at the bottom of 'Dark Tranquility', as this level in Vrtnarija had now dropped below the known extent of M2; the main expedition aim in 2009 was to try and connect Vrtnarija to Sistem Migovec. Cave exploration progressed quickly and easily, with depth building at the rate at which pitches could be safely rigged, gardened and surveyed.

Within two weeks of the caving commencing we had bottomed Happy Monday (P81m), with the resulting survey data indicating an almost inevitable intersection with the horizontal development at -550m in Vrtnarija (Friendship Gallery). The next team down pushed through the terrifying boulder choke at the floor of the chamber ('Hanging Garden'), gained a well developed rift with phreatic crawlspace at the top, and pushed downwards until they found an old bolt just beyond a small confluence.

Plotting the data back on the mountain top it was clear that they had intersected 'Falls Road', a set of tight active rifts accessed just below Friendship gallery. The next trip into the cave went via the main pitch series and dropped a rope down from this 'Prima junction', intersecting the rigging left by the previous push. Strangely the 2001/2003 explorers had missed the lead towards 'Happy Monday', even though the end of the large rift forms one of the original rebelay bolts for the confluence pitch.

The last camping trip saw an epic list of 'must do this year' tasks, dropping into the newly discovered Tolminska Korita via the easily passed main pitch series, taking pictures of new discoveries and undocumented pitches along the way, recording the new discoveries from 'Fools road' back to 'Walk the Line', resting overnight at camp, then descending to the connection point once more to finish off the survey, investigate the 'Muddy Window' phreatic 10m above the floor of Happy Monday, and derig back to camp before resting again and then striking camp in the morning.

### Climbs near Camp

'Metal Aven' (C+30m) still has places left to scale, but appears from the survey to reconnect to an earlier part in the fault (we believe) controlled cave development in this region.

'KETI' (C+23m) consisted of an extremely exposed climb (across a 65m pitch) to gain a rift jammed with unstable boulders which were traversed to eventually realise a non-human sized connection to a low part of Metal Aven. We had hoped that this rift would trend South, towards M2, but instead almost immediately doubled-back on itself in a North-East direction.

'Ride the Lightning' (C+16m), a climb of the twin shaft to Kill 'em All pitch, gained a small section of passage which ended at a pitch, estimated as being 30m deep. Lack of gear and time prevented its exploration, though the survey indicates it may be in the vicinity of the bottom of 'Dangermouse' (2009, P52m), and may yet hold the key to bypassing the immature and unpassably small rift which the Dangermouse water disappeared down.

### Deep Push to Republika

A lightweight bounce-push was made to -734m to look at a major lead left at the end of the 2004 deep camping expedition. Due to a miscommunication during 2004, the upstream 'tube tunnel' sized passage was left unexplored until the last camping trip, everyone having assumed that 'Cow' died with a sump. This was pushed upstream over a few small cascades to reach a large watershed (Republika Palma de Cocco) with the water entering from a high aven, literally splitting on a triangular rock. It is hypothesised that this water could be coming from Tolminska Korita,  130m away in both vertical and horizontal directions. From the watershed, the new passage was followed downstream to a 13m pitch which was rigged with the tiny amount of gear that the party had with them. This took them to a large active rift development, with an unplumbed depth estimated at being in the region of 30m. With no more rigging gear, they surveyed out. The plan of this area is interesting, with the two streams describing a crescent, with the end of the rift in the new area being just 16m away from the previous sump, indicating that this sump is almost certainly perched and may feed onto the same pitch series.

This was an extremely happy discovery for this cave, as the maximum depth of -802m is believed to be some 200m above the shale-band controlled water-table, and an active pitch has the potential to punch through the sandy choked passage that otherwise dominate this area of horizontal development.

### October 2009

A small JSPDT/ICCC team returned to M2 on a weekend in October. Chemical persuasion was used to open the terminal rift in the floor, leading to another small chamber. The phreatic passage further on from the 2008 climb was dug out and extended to a point estimated at 30m from the base of the pitch which marked the end of exploration in 2008. The wet pitches were derigged on the way out and the cave was left till summer 2010.

## Achievements

Three major climbs around camp:
    * Metal Aven (C+30m)
    * KETI (C+23m)
    * Ride the Lightning (C+16m)

225m Depth added to Dark Tranquillity until Connection (-338m --> -563m)
    * Mirage Canyon (P28m)
    * Wet Hammer (P18m)
    * Two Minutes to Midnight (P43m)
    * I Walk the Line (C+6m/P15m)
    * A Pitch Named Sue (P17m)
    * Happy Monday (P81m)
    * Hanging Garden (P10m)

Tolminska Korita (below Zimmer) pushed for -45m:
   * Eggstravaganza (P10m)
   * Eggsplosive (P5m/P19m)

## Outlook for 2010

Five Major leads still going deep in Vrtnarija at the end of 2009 – two large phreatics separated by 120m and heading in opposite directions (Leopard -539m, Muddy Window -529m), two large active pitch series (Tolminska Korita -585m, Republika -737m) and the rather tight Fools/Falls Road (-577m).

In Captain Kangaroo we have the aforementioned Ride the Lightning pitch to drop, as well as a multitude of narrow rifts which require expansion to pass at -190 to -270m.

## Logistics

Our logistics have been heavily optimised over the last ten years of returning to this same plateau. The main difficulty is in lifting (this year purely through manpower) our food and equipment from Tolminska Ravne (where we can drive to) at 912m to the bivouac in a shakehole under a rockbridge at 1860m ('The Bivi').

A further optimisation that we have carried out the last few years is in using the derig carries at the end of the previous year to bring up sufficient non-perishable foods (rice, pasta etc.) to eat during the first half of the expedition in the present year. This way, caving can start fully after just two or three carries per team member, rather than the more traditional 'week of carries' that characterised the old six-week expeditions!

A further refinement was leaving from London with the Minibus on Friday night. Though rather harsh on the drivers, this meant that we arrived in Tolmin on Saturday just in time for a well-earned proper meal and a full night of sleep before an alpine start. Up shortly after dawn, we had managed to acquire the necessary petrol for cooking and other locally bought fresh food.

Our drill batteries were charged on mains power down in the village and then carried up, but power for rechargeable lights, survey laptop, MP3 player & underground camp speakers were all provided for by a small photovoltaic tent placed next to a tent.

## Zimmer streamway
James and Dave went for a quick bounce trip to look at the undescended pitch below Zimmer chamber, which started with a traverse in a rift part-filled with boulders.

Bolts for the traverse led to a point where a drop into a water could be seen. On bolting and descending this, the landing was in a shallow pool, with water coming from some way back in the rift, having been collected on the floor of Zimmer chamber after running through the boulders from both waterfalls.

The water then ran from the pool to cascade down a series of short drops in a clean-washed rift with a friable slabby roof/wall overhanging it, and eventually a point was reached with a drop too long to free-climb down, with the passage beyond bending to the left and seeming to carry on descending.

This certainly seemed like it had some potential, and was interesting in that (with the exception of Republica) it was the first decent-flow active streamway encountered at depth as part of a main route, rather than a streamway crosing the passage appearing from and going to nowhere accessible.

A pleasant little bounce trip with an interesting and attractive find.

James, Jana and Dave returned a couple of days later to push a little and take photographs, and while James and Jana got to work, Dave went to drop a rope down to Falls Road from Friendship Gallery, since the Capt. K. crew had seemed likely to have reached there at a lower level a day or two before, and a rope would enable a through-trip. On descending, their anchors were found, showing that they actually had been where we had calculated.

### First night train trip down Captain Kangaroo  - Tim and Thara - written by Tharatorn Supasiti

13-14/08/09

Tim and I descended down Captain Kangaroo for the second and the last time in this expo. Our two main objectives were to dislodge a boulder at the pitch head of Kill 'em all and to further push the bottom of Happy Monday as left by Jana and Dan previously. For the latter objective, we expected a connection with the main GW system as explored in early 00's from the most recent cave data.

Somehow we ended up on a night train, which is my first. We took off from the bivvi after sunset. While changing into our respective caving gears at GW entrance, we knew that those left at the bivvi were having fun with newly-acquired laser by a green beam that pierced through Migovec's night fog. 

Upon arriving Metal Camp, we headed straight to complete the first objective. I crawled through a tight pitch head and at once I knew that I have arrived at Kill 'em All by the Y-hang that was set below the ledge. A haunted memory of my previous struggles to pass through this head in either ways, came flooding back. I could only take comfort in knowing that today would be the last time that anyone will ever have to experience this struggle between rock (+gravity) and man. 

On the surface, during the previous days, there was a growing concern by numerous parties that had to pass through this head that the rock on which one of the two bolts that made up the Y-hang has developed a widening crack. It was only a matter of time until this boulder would dislodge unto unfortunate souls still half-way through the descent/ascent. So, it was Tim and I's job to secure this passage. 

Since I am small to allow myself to swing a hammer at the head, I was assigned with the chiselling duty. After derigging the pitch, it didn't take too long with chisel in one hand and a lump hammer in the other to dislodge a table size boulder down the pitch. And it crashed with a loud thud that echoed through the chamber below.   

A half an hour later, after Tim put a new bolt, we returned to the camp considering a job well-done.

The next night (or day by our standard), we continued Dan and Jana's lead down Happy Monday through a gap between loose rock and its wall. Little did we know that we, indeed, were kept up there by pure friction on the cavern wall. A double hammer action quickly led us into a chamber below Happy Monday. I was the first to descend into the unknown chamber.

Upon looking towards the ceiling, I noticed three large boulders suspended mid-air that formed the roof of this chamber. And the only thing that prevent the roof from collapsing is the friction between boulders and the cavern wall. The name for this chamber is obviously "Hanging Garden" and I knew that I had to get out of here ASAP.

The way onward was obvious. We followed the rift to a 5m pitch that dropped into a flat white floor, where water flew through. A bit further down, having found a spitz on a wall, we realised that we had made a CONNECTION!  (It wasn't until the next trip that the survey was tied in. We couldn't find a survey station.)

I went back up the same rift, while Tim attempted to rig a line across to a window opposite the rift we were in. After shivering in the cold for hours (it was 4am), my morale was at the lowest. And I begged Tim to survey and get out. 

During surveying the new section, a loose fell from the pitch head and sliced through our tape. Luckily, that was near the end of our survey. 

The journey back to the camp was arguably one of my most hallucinating experience I ever I encountered in the cave. Having been broken at 4am, my body refused to answer the call of duty to migrate towards bed. I didn't remember how I got back to the camp, but got back we did. Exhausted, I resorted to ignore food and went straight to sleep, while Tim sorted out his bowel less than ten metres away. ...

We exited the cave by 4am. 

After 55 hours of holding in, the shit pitch finally called me... ... 

NB: I thought to myself then, never will I go on a night train again. This was broken in 2012. I only went on night train trips.

Climbing Metal aven

We set off for a doss day and decided to climb the 4m aven on top of the tent at Metal camp. The aven leads to a roomy room (there is a lead off a side chamber). Izi climbed up to a bolder move at that point I scurried down and fetched rope for Izi. I secured a rope to a sling and I joined him. The next move looked fine. So I roped up (with the superstatic) and Izi belayed me to a few dubious flakes where the crurx was! Crux! Exposed move 10m off the terrace secured by a superstatic rope and to vary dubious sling. Anyways.....Another mudy chamber was reached pushed to the left to a narrow muddy squeeze (not really worth digging, I am HO) and a rift to the right which was pushed to a constriction (lead). Which could be easily bashed – probably the connection.

### Jana and Dan --- 63h pushing underground

7--10th August 2009

We were suppose to be on a night train team following Tim and Thara. But after spending a day quite active (caving and a carry) we decided to go down in an early morning. Set an alarm for 5 AM and start caving at 6.30AM. Down in the camp we woke the day team Tim and Thara. After breakfast and a chat we swop the BEAST comf and go back to sleep. Thara and Tim continue pushing the lead, which is still going. They come back at 10 PM and woke us up. Our first time sleeping in a camp was quite broken. For the first 5,6 h we didn't really sleep. We also put extra extra comf in our sleeping bags – it was cold!

Tim and Thara pushed the cave for 2 pitches down: 10m and 34m. Afterwards there is a climb up a bolder choke where they stopped. So we went up, where on the other side was a pitch down. We spend two hours rigging and gardening. Basically they are rocks and bolders all around the pitch head. Going up and down was still dangerous – stones constantly falling down. Needed to be re-rigged. The way on then continue up and into another smaller bolder choke. Under there was a small pitch down. From there we first climb up the rock and end up above big black hole. We throw a stone down and we can hear that there wats a long way down – 4s! Fucking hell – that is like 80m pitch. Very excited we keep on throwing stones down. The echo at the bottom was amazing. We could also hear that there was a big slope at the bottom. From here the rigging down was not really good. So we looked for a alternative way into a pitch. Further down there is a rift, which you climb into it and it takes you straight to the pitch – beautiful place to bolt. Here we decided to survey from here back to the walk the line. Back in the camp after around 12h of caving.

Tim and Thara finish their caving in GW and went back out. Alone in the cave we had to set up an alarm. We were woken up by Tjasa, Izi and Erik, which were on a day trip to do some climbing in Primula. We re-start the alarm like 3 times and on the end end up 15h in bed! We finally got up at 5 AM and start caving at 7.30AM. We were excited, finally going down the big pitch and to see how big it really is. We took two bolting kits to speed up. I spend time re-riggin, bolting and more gardening below Walk the line and Dan went down to start bolting the big pitch. After 3 hours we were ready to descent. Dan offered me to go down first. I was ready to go and looking down was just a bit scary, plus not having practice in dealing with enormous pitches I thought would be better if Dan goes down first. He made another bolt approx half way down on a tiny ledge. When he come down he shouted – O, my god, it is really big! Quickly followed down, looking around on the way- Amazing! At the bottom we explored around and found the way on under the bolder choke. There is another approx 10m pitch on. We had some lunch and then was time to survey it. The bottom was impressive 20x20m. Cuz the tape was not long enough we had to mark the rope, using a zink-oxide tape twice on a way up. The length to the rigging spot was 75m+15m to the top. And there it was - a 90m pitch. Pleased with our mission we had to speed up to get out on time. Our call out was 10PM. We stopped in a Metal camp for hot chok and to pack the stuff to be taken out. We were out from the bottom in 6h. Back in the bivy at 9.45PM.

We had a great trip and it was first time for both of us to be underground for so long and to discover such a big pitch – which still does not have a name.

The next day, during the breakfast time we decides to name it: Happy Monday.

Izi, Dan , Jarv @E1

Took 27 caps. Used them all. A lot were double or bust, but still ~18 shot holes ~15cm deep, using only 1/3 of the 7.5 Ah SLA battery (24V with the Bosch). Blew a lot of rock.

Surveyed out, ~30 m deep.

14/08/09

Jarv, Gergely

Back with Gergely – two more caps some hammer & chisel action & we were through! Placed a rawl (stainless) for pitch.

New chamber is ~ 2x3 m with 4 m climb into prior discovered stuff.

Rubble on floor – dug for ~10'.

Got to bedrock.

No better nor worst than capped pitch, but not the stunning lead we were hoping for.

13-14/08/09

Thara and Tim

Fixed Kill'Em'All disloadged a large boulder down the pitch. New bolt was put in place.

14-15
Thara and Tim
Continued down Dan's lead down one more pitch – double hammer action lead into a chamber clearly below Happy Monday. Hanging death a size of whole chamber kept everything from falling down. It's like anti-gravity room where rock just floats itself in the sky. Followed an obvious riftt to a 5 m pitch into another chamber
.flat floor with a lot water coming through just like Yorkshire caves
.walked further downstream and found spitz – clear someone has been here before
.back to chamber Tim treid to rig a traverse line across to another lead half finished before heading off

Thara was completely broken by the top of Happy Monday while Tim's bowel rumbled once again. Great find and survey.

Left: rope
some bolting kit + tape +sling at the bottom of happy monday
    
hammer  and chisle
    
at the top of   kill'em all


PS: From final pitch, there is a traverse line to the right. It is not great as a proper traverse, but if you descent the main pitch, you can use the traverse line with a cows tail to reach the other side. There is a bolt to go down from there but it needs a backup. Once rigged it would be better to descend main rope then up the other one.

Down to Zimmer + connection

The two goals of this trip were to find the rope that Tim and Thara rigged from Happy Monday plus survey and rig the rift below Zimmer.
The connection is found at Falls Road. Climbing down at the rift of the connection of Falls road and friendship gallery a ~10m drop reaches a Y hang to the top of Free Amalgamation. The bottom of happy mondat is about 40 m away.
Below Zimmer and active streamway is found with beautiful lakes and a high meander. Top muddy passage of meander is passable, but a drop down to the waterfalls would be better. Probably the largest active known streamway on the mountain at the moment, highly probably it leads somewhere unknown. Nice falls and waterfalls.

Super nice trip – show-cave area!

17-08-09

Neither of us had been further in the system than Hotline so there was a bit of stumbling around to reach NCB. Got to see some of the big cave system has, that I would not see in the uk. When we reached what we thought was the west end of NCB the only thing we could find that was possibly an undescended pitch described were two large holes further back that connected at the bottom. However, there were two holes at the bottom of that, one was descended one was not. While James froze I descended 20 m to find very little at all and we decided to head out. The way up was slightly marred when I sent a large bolder down where James had been standing moments before. Otherwise we got out in good time and slop was still lukewarm. We were told afterwards that NCB had a different west , so it is unclear where we went.
FROM THE UG CAMP LOG BOOK

30/31 July 09, Andy and Jarv, The first one

Two heavy sacks from the surface, picked up 4 comf sacks at the Traverse chamber. Passed threw squeezes with the aid of the handl ? Cord. 'Something fishy' was a bit of a campsiteb-only room for one pit.
Dumped sacks and continued to look for greener pasteures..and refound here! Looked very nice at first – a few drips, flat, dry-ish mud.
Moved rocks and set a tent – the place not looked so good, bit of a guagmire?. Found 1,5L of water in Something Fishy – drips provided about 5mL overnight.

SO Dangersmouse/drips on Kill em All way have to be the way forward....
